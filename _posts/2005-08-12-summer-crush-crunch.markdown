Crunch time in the summer should be illegal.  I'm really enjoying my job until the pressure builds then it's just like an assignment that needs to get done.  Thing is, this assignment needs 100% on it (by Thursday) or I fail (well not _really_).  Thursday is when I'm presenting the final product to the Dean and there's still tons to get done.  UGH

In other news, life is good!
