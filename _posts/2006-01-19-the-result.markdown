Okay.. so.. I think I've really been hyping the readers up for "the post" or "some huge revelation about life".  Maybe I'm mildy insecure of losing readers due to my lack of interesting posts.  So maybe stringing everyone will keep them coming.  So I'll wrap it up the best I can.

Went to a conference from Thursday to Saturday on how to hear God speak.  It was really eye openning.  So he's encouraging us to pray for dreams from God and that we would have encouraging words for others.  The weird thing is, I've been able to have a "word" or two for people and them saying it was right on!  Nutsa!

I'm thinking a lot about long term these days.  Starting with the summer, talking to profs about jobs and final projects for next summer and even considering after in graduate.  That's more than a year away!!  I should try to relax and take the advice from the course I just took and listen for what God wants.  I mean, he has a much better view of the playing field than any of us eh? ;)
