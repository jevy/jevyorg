Well, it's 6pm in Suburbia... *ding dong* it starts with "the neighbors with the annoying barking dog".  Too bad Oct 31st isn't as big as it was back in the day.  Man, there was the craziest stuff going on.  We'd strap on rollarblades to hit the houses mega fast and have french people yell at us: "Ils sont trop vieux la".  LOL!
