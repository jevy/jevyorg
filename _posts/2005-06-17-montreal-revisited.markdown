I had an absolute blast adn am really stoked that I stayed the extra days.  The project going on is similiar to "Toronto Project" that I was at two summers ago for those who remember that.  Anyways, it's the transition the main responsibility from the paid staff to the students on project so I was visiting in the middle of that.  Needless to say it was pretty busy so I as sorta on the outside looking in.  By Thurday though I had met a whack of people and they really included me and was able to pray with a bunch of them.  Makes me miss project (for the relational aspect) but I know God's got something great in store for me this summer so I'm excited for that too.

I'll post of pictures of Montral once I pull them off my camera.
