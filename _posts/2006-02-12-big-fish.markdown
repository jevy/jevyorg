<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319061/"><img width="65" height="96" class="alignleft" id="image255" alt="Big Fish" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/28m.thumbnail.jpg" /></a>I was skeptical as so many people really hated this movie before I saw it.  I don't want to be critical of them but I think the key to this movie is to just embrace the story.  I am so grateful to have an imagination and to want to dream in the same way that the characters did in this movie.  Maybe it's because I love <a href="http://jevy.org/2005/05/20/memories/">remembering</a> <a href="http://jevy.org/2005/09/11/a-walk-to-remember/">old</a> <a href="http://jevy.org/2005/05/20/lazy/">times</a>.  I hope that doesn't mean that I live in the past.

This movie is absolutely beautiful and I hope that I will be as satisfied with my life as Ed was.  Open your heart and love it.
