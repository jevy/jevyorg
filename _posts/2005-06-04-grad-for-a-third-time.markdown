Well went with Eleesha to her St. Peter's graduation last night.  Went to the garden party way too early (started at 3, got there at 3:15) when there wasn't really anyone there.  People are so cutting and superficial, just overhearing some people talking about others it cut me deep even not knowing who they're talking about.

The dinner/dance was at the Westin.  Quite a nice hotel really.  The food was really good and the people at our table were hilarious.  I sort of forgot that these people are 3-4 years younger than me.  Anyways, we hit the dance for and it was a killer!  My date wanted to dance with her girlfriends which was totally fine so I went to dance with the people from our table.  Everyone left really early to go pre-drink for the aftergrad I assume (seems so odd to me now).  I was totally in the dancing mood to hit up the aftergrad but we didn't go.  That's cool too.  Anyways, solid time.
