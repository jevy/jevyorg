	<li>I watched a Spice Girls documentary the other day.  I really hadn't realized how huge they were until they showed all their hits.  They were HUGE!  WHOA!  It's sad when you see where they're all at now, a bunch are divorced with kids and doing random stuff un-related to their field (thanks wikipedia).  I guess there's a season for everything.</li>
	<li>My team at work went to play paintball today for our Christmas party.  What a blast!  I thought I was pretty darn good if I do say so myself.  Those long hours playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_strike">Counter Strike</a> have finally paid off.</li>
	<li>Ruby on Rails is stinking unreal!  It's like the designers knew of all my headaches developing with J2EE and made it super simple for me.  WOW!!!  Let the fun times begin!</li>
	<li>So my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jevy/sets/72157594460179337/">pic-a-day</a> only made it to March.  I can't find the initial announcement post and some of the pictures are archives because I went passed the limit of free pictures displayed :( I found it pretty frustrating and stressful having to carry a camera with me all the time but it did help to appreciate everyday for what it's worth.</li>
	<li>Peter Mansbridge is still my hero</li>
</ul>

Goodnight!
