I just found out that my website looks like poo poo in internet explorer (use Firefox peoples!).  This website actually causes me frustration.  Like what the heck?  I try to fix it up but I don't enjoy it.  Maybe I just want it to look pro because I feel it should be.  Maybe because it's something that I can show off to people but the problem is, I'm far from satisfied with how it looks.  I'm not sure why, but I'm actually stressed about it.  Man!  What the heck?  Oh well, I just need to tell myself it's really not that big of a deal if I can't have a nice website even if all I want is something simple.

*whimper*
