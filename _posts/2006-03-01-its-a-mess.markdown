If you don't believe me, check out my not so tidy (anymore) desktop.  Maybe I'll have time to clean 'er up on the weekend.

I wonder if most people really feel like they don't have things in place.  I mean, I can deal with the openendedness (is that a word?) but it's just having things hanging over my head (either good or bad) that really add to well.. this tension in my neck.
