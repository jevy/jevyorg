I recognize my posting has been at an all time low but things are going relatively well!  Still have too much on the go but I'm starting to cut back for the sake of sanity (it's the summer for goodness sakes! Relax time!).  I also have lots of pictures to post but I forgot the usb cable from my camera to my computer so that'll have to wait.  Upcoming stuff:
<ul>
	<li>June 7-11 - Down to St.Catherine's (well, <a href="http://city.portcolborne.on.ca/">Port Colborne</a>) to visit the Canadian <a href="http://www.omcanada.org">Operation Mobilization</a> office.  They're doing an orientation for all those interested doing a longer term project.  I'd like to do a year with them when I graduate so I want to see if it's a good fit.</li>
	<li>June 15 - My first golf tournament ever!  Thank goodness it's best ball and that I'm not being depended upon.</li>
</ul>
I hope things slow down in July so I can start taking on mini projects that I won't have time for during the year.
