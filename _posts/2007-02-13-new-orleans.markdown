So I'm from Ottawa's suburb of Orleans and I'm off to New Orleans tomorrow!  It's almost like they're ripping off my 'hood!  .. but they're not.. at all.

In any case, Mardi Gras is going to be happening and I'm sure that will be something else!  We'll be doing more outreach however and helping those who have been devistated by the hurricane.  I'm sure I'll have plenty of (clean!) pictures for y'all.  Play safe!
