Well not quite.. but they're close!  I just realized how bad of a speeler I really am!  I need a better spellcheck or something.

San Francisco is a really great city.  The people are beautiful and there are many nice cards driving around.

I need a good church to go to on Sunday.  Would someone mind doing some research and reply with some ideas?  Thanks much!
