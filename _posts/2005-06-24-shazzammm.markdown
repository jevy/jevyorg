Holy Toledo!  I think my prof feels that I've been working hard enough in the lab that he recommended me to the Dean to do some work for him.  I met with the two women who do engineering recruitment for Carleton and they want me to work on two robots that they have to take around to high schools.

Soooooo I get paid to make these things do cool stuff??!?!  WHATTTTT.  It's 17.5 hours a week which is awesome so I'll have enough time to work for Radialink (if that ever comes through).  Praise God!  I'm so glad I gave this summer to Him.
