It's true!  I confess, I'm a geek.  I just spent two hours looking a blogs getting ideas for my new website.  I'm not really keen on doing it right now but it seems like a great distraction from school (not that I have done any real homework yet).

I'm not sure why I'm so keen on blogging.  Do I feel I have something worthwhile to say?  Is it a way to gain popularity or to convince people that I'm trying to be smart?  Really though, I think it's just me wanting to stay in touch with everyone else (wether or not I even know you) because I really enjoying sharing life with people.  Hope everyone had a super weekend.
