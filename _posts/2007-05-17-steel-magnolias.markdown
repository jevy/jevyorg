Steel MagnoliasSo with the Roger's Digital box thinger, they have a rolling selection of free movies.  WHATTTTT!!!  So I've spent some time watching a couple of them.

Tonight I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098384/">Steel Magnolias</a> (okay, so the selection isn't that great).  I have to say I actually quite enjoyed it!  The writing was great in that they were able to really convey the serious parts and yet lighten the mood at just the right time.  I'm trying to think of a more eloquent way to say that but that's all I've got.

By the end as they were driving off to the hospital, I cried just a bit and just really want to appreciate life more.  I have this tendency to not really enjoy myself unless I "seize every moment".  I'm starting to learn that life is in the day to day and really appreciating even the small joys, and sad times.  Maybe that's why I liked this movie.  It wasn't really about anything spectacular event, but the day to day happening in these women's lives and them enjoying it.

.. I'm glad I had this little discussion with myself.  I hope by you reading this post it will make it feel less like a self pep talk.  Cheers!
