<a title="Fight Club" class="imagelink" rel="attachment" id="p339" href="http://jevy.org/?attachment_id=339"><img alt="Fight Club" id="image339" class="alignleft" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/28m.jpg" /></a><span class="imagelink">You know those movies that you've always wanted to see and everyone says is really good but won't watch it with you because they've seen it four times already?  Well, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/">Fight Club</a> is one of those movies for me.  The humour was subtle, the characters awesome and moral-of-the-story interesting.  I remember once renting a movie at Roger's Video I saw that there was an "actor/actress look alike contest" going on.  I asked the guy at the counter if I could pull off being someone and he said maybe Edward Norton.  I'm thinking that was maybe his default answer to I'm sure a good number of people asking him.</span>

Anyways, the movie.  Yeah,  I ended up having to rent it by myself which was fine since it's been a long week and I was going to visit with my parents as I haven't seen them in a couple of weeks.  Some people will hate that movie, and that's fine.. just don't talk to me about it then ;)
