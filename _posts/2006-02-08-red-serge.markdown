I just found out that my dad will be guarding the singer at the Sens-Rangers game tonight.  It's to promote Canadian tourism or something.  Anyways, if anyone's interested, it's covered by TSN.  I told him to get pictures with Alfie and I think it's funny that the Rangers want to have pictures with HIM!  haha
