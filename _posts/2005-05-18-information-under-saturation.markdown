Well, I called <a href="http://www.get3web.com">3web</a> today and we're potentially looking at another week without internet.  That sucks.  On the bright side I can do other productive stuff like.. errr......  I'll probably think of something.  The lab work is pretty interesting actually, I'm working with embedded systems that will be used in the robots built here.  Not much in other news.

I guess new contact info is imporant:
Home phone (613) 236-7341
Cell (same as always)
Lab: 520-2600 x2600
