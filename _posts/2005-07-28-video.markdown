I thought this was the coolest thing when driving back from TO with Matt and Jay.  You might have to be at <a href="http://jevy.org">jevy.org</a> to view it properly.  I'll be sure to hold the camera properly next time.  Anyways, here it is: <a href="javascript:playFlvVideo('McDDriveThru')">McD's</a>.

P.S.  We demand props for having American Pie playing in the background ;)
