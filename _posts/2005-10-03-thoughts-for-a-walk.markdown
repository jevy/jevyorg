I skipped classes today *gasp* since I had plenty of work to do.  I felt so dirty staying in my PJs until 8pm tonight.  I changed and headed out on likely the nicest night we'll have before winter hits.  I think I've mentioned it before, but this neighbourhood is all grown up now.  I'm sure the majority of the people I played with in the park back in the day have moved away to do other stuff.  Which is fine, but it's nice to remember them.  I like the walks to simply clear my head of all sorts of things.  I try not to think about things much when I'm walking since things never really get sorted out there anyways.  So it's mainly praying and wandering.

So we're studying for Quantum Mechinics over <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype </a> tonight using <a href="http://www.groupboard.com/">Groupboard</a> to do some visuals.  We didn't use it for anything useful other than <a href="http://bewblog.blogspot.com/">Chan </a> and I making funny pictures.  Credit to him for the Mortal Kombat knock off though.

Rich blessings y'all
