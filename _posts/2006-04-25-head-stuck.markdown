This whole CD is fantastic.  Some people are sold on lyrics (usually I could care less about the words if the music is quality).  If I <a href="http://jevy.org/2006/04/24/the-itunes-bug/">haven't convinced</a> you, this is from Weekend Players - Pursuit of Happiness:
<blockquote>we're in pursuit of happiness
order of the day
and we're on, on a mission to make it true
we do it most every day

step back and look where you are
move away from the grey clouds passin' by
keep strong
and it won't be long until there's better times

and we're feelin' all right
we're driftin' on by
and we're feelin' all right
we're driftin' on by

we're all needin' much the same
in order, order to live
i know, no one said it wasn't hard
to get back what you give</blockquote>
