Found this CD in the car as I was driving home on Friday.  I'm sure my brother buys new CDs on nearly a daily basis (which is good for me).  Check <a href="http://www.newmusiccanada.com/genres/artist.cfm?Band_Id=12926">them</a> out, in particular "Plates and Saucers".  I wish they put up "Books" but it's not there, out well.  Quality Ottawa music.
