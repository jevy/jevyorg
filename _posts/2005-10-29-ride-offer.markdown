Ott to TO/Guelph (Round Trip)

Leaving from Carleton Thursday, Nov 10th at 5:30pm.  Drop off in TO/Mississauga is flexible but close to the 401 would be nice.  Returning the afternoon of Sunday, Nov 13th.

I'm pretty unsure of my own plans so we can work stuff out.  I wanted to offer it to jevy.org and livejournal readers first before I post on the ott.rides newsgroup.  I'll let you know how much gas will be but of course that depends on how many come.  I can take 4 plus 1 on the roof.  If you take the roof, you get a discount on gas.  I cruise at 115km/h since this matters to some people.

Requirements for the ride:
<ul>
	<li>Bladder must be able to handle stopping for rest stops no more than 10 times.</li>
<li>Must stink less than a wet dog</li>
	<li>Easy going with music selection as I might just whip out some Justin Timberlake and Salt and Peppaaaaaaa.  Uhh.. but I won't so don't worry</li>
	<li>Be cool if we don't feel like talking the entire way.</li>
</ul>

Let me know
