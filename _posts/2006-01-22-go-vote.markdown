I'll be workin' poll 103 for electoral district 35062.  The only reason I know that is I had to fill out about 20 forms/envelopes for tomorrow's vote.  Should be an interesting day.  The lady I'll be working with is pretty funny: "Can I call you BUDDY?"  "haha.. sure thing!"

I've been following the campaigns at the federal level between the Tories, Liberals, NDP and Bloc.  Before the campaign, I'm sure everyone thought it was going to end up the same as it did before the vote was called.  Although it really looks like it may not at all!

I'm sick of how people think I'm a jerk or somehow intolerant if I'm voting conservative.  Worse even is that people think I'm voting for them because I am Christian therefore my vote MUST go towards a certain party:  "what's wrong with you?  You're voting for PC?  Harper's the scariest man alive!  It's because you're Christian isn't it.  You want to end up like the States?  What are you doing?".  Come on guys, I am making a free vote based on my own convictions and I'm pretty sure other Christians are doing the same.
