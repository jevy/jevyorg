<img class="center" id="image257" alt="Dog Love" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/dog_love3.gif" />Got home to find some lifesavers and chocolate sitting on my desk (thanks mom!).  This is a depressing day for lots of people I'm sure and my heart goes out to those who are missing past loves.

In the mean time for me, I'm dreaming about and praying for my future love, so this one goes out to her:  S'up Mrs. Maltais.
