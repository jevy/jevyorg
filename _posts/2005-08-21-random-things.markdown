<ul><li>Just found out that I have a hacked perl or php script somewhere on my site.  Pretty sure it was my older version of squirrelmail but I'll be watching my email sent out closely.</li>


	<li>I _really_ want to redesign this site but it's just getting started that sucks</li>


	<li>Heading to NYC this week and am really interested in some quality things to do during the day.</li>

	<li>Moving hope in just more than a week</li>


	<li>The people subletting the apt upstairs I swear have metal feet and move their house around all day long.  I hear them from 7am until 3am.  It's so strange.</li>
</ul>
