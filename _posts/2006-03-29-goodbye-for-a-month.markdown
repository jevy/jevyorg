title: Goodbye for a Month

So, I finally have all the hardware I need to work on the robots.  The problem?  It's due for the end of April and I was supposed to start in the beginning of Feburary.  So, since I've accumulated hours that I haven't used yet, I'm having to really work my butt off for this whole month.  I might have to cut my socializing down for a little while :S
