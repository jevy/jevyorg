I was watching the National tonight learning about how the Tories have cut money from the environment departments (nooooo!!).  A group called Hinterland Who's Who also were part of those programs cut.  "Oh well" I thought until the unforgettable single flute began to play.  OH MY GOODNESS!  It takes me back to my TVO days.
