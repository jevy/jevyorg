<p>So this flipping sucks.  Mould is my #1 thing that I'm sensitive too and since my apartment is circa 1930, it's FULL of it.  That said, I've decided to move back to my parent's place come Monday.  Ugh.  I'm all set up and this place and housemates are both amazing.  Back to the bus and hour long commutes every school day.  Giddy up!<br />
I really need to get better (see <a href="http://jevy.org/2006/10/03/going-up/">last post</a>).
