Can I borrow (or buy) the Chronicles of Narnia set off someone?  The only reason I say buy is that it may be awhile since you get them back.  If you do lend them, I can assure you I remember who I borrowed them from.

I need more reading material for the bus.  The newspaper is really not helping :P

<strong>Update</strong>: AWESOME!  Thanks Rob.
