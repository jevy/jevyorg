So, we're picking up the keys to the new apartment tomorrow.  Normally it's not a big deal but now that I'm out for the whole year for the first time I decided to put together a list (on here) of things I'll miss and be glad about.

Things I won't miss:
<ul>
	<li>2 hours on the bus everyday (got lots of reading done though)</li>
	<li>My brother playing the drums SO LOUD at the most inconvenient times.</li>
	<li>Being relatively far away from the "action" of downtown and my Carleton peeps</li>
	<li>Being able to try some new foods out.</li>
	<li>Not being able to use my bike to get places.</li>
</ul>
Things I will miss:
<ul>
	<li>Daily advice I could get from mom/dad/brother.</li>
	<li>Food at the table consistantly that I didn't have to really.. err.. make</li>
	<li>A clean house that I don't have to pay rent for or worry about electricity costs.</li>
	<li>Quick access to a car to whip around to run arrands.</li>
</ul>
