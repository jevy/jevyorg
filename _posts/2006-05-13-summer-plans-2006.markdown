Well, here I am typing from our new place which now has some three prong plugs (!) and internet.  I think we feel that since there is now that we have internet, there's now some more stability in the house.  Man, that sounds so sad.  Last summer, I <a href="http://jevy.org/2005/05/11/summer-plans/">made some </a>tentative plans (I remember them being more detailed) and I'd like to do the same for this summer:
<ul>
	<li>Work and get the organization to like me for later possibilities (?)</li>
	<li>Work on my creativity.  I've got my <a href="http://www.nikon.ca/products/d50/">Nikon D50</a> on order which should really allow me to expand on my current photography possibilites (only so much you can do with a point and shoot).  I'd love to re make my website (have I mentioned this before?) as I have some fun ideas but can't until I've cleaned some other stuff off my.  See below.</li>
	<li>Finish with <a href="http://jevy.org/videos?url=Robot%20Demo.flv">Felix and Faye</a>[old video] _as soon as possible_ so I don't have that hanging over my head.</li>
	<li>Get in better cardio shape.  I've joined two volleyball teams at work, one ultimate team and bike to work.  I think I might be over reaching but whatever.</li>
	<li>Try cooking plenty of new stuff.</li>
	<li>Hang out tons and pull off a couple of roadtrips.</li>
</ul>
