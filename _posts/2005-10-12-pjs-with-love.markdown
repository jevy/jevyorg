Doing homework for 10 hours?  No problem!  The key?  Do it in the your PJs.  I stayed home for the day to finish an assignment worth 10% of my final mark.  It's music to my eyes (or something):
<code>

I'm really not sure what to do about all these earthquakes and just general devistation that's happening all around the world.  I'm debating on what my response should be to all of this.  Honestly, hearing that 20K+ people have died is really just a number to me.  I really would like to feel more compassion for them all but literally every month there is something new to give money, pray for, feel bad for.  Is it the media's fault?  I don't think so, they're just telling us what's happening.  Is it my fault?  I hope not, I mean, these are the natural emotions that are coming.  ?!?!?!?!??!
