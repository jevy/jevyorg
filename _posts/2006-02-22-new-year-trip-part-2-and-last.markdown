<div class="alert"><strong>Update:</strong> Alison also <a href="http://chiefspymaster.livejournal.com/227824.html">posted </a>about her NYC trip.  Which we are included in.</div>
So I didn't end up blogging as much as I thought I would while I was there.  I think we're better off.  I posted all my pics on my (new) photo gallery.  I'll be cleaning up that gallery soon.  Anyways.  Check it out <a href="http://jevy.org/photos/v/nyc2k6/">here</a>!

It was a blast of a trip.  Hostel was great (except for the showers).  Saw "The Producers", hit up MoMa, ate TONS, spent enough, walking dead streets in the middle of the night, checked some of the "<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4245337360492479670&q=lazy+sunday">Lazy Sunday</a>" landmarks, ate more, hung out with CRU friends from Queens... and more!

.. I just forget the rest ..

.. holy crap .. do I ever love flying.
