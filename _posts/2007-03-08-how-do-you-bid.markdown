I just came across this really cool website put on by everyone's favorite online auction - Ebay!  It basically goes through all the personality types who shop on the site to have you relate to someone on there.  It's really a great marketing technique to sort of develop a community in the sense that somehow, Ebay acknowledges that you're in it for the adrenaline rush, the good deals whatever!  Somehow, I feel more validated as an Ebay-er now.  Which personality am I?  HA!  Wouldn't that take all the fun out it if you knew my strategy?

Sidenote, I've probably bought and sold about 40 things on Ebay over the years.  It seems like quite a bit really.
