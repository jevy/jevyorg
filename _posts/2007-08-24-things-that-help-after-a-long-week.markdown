<ul>
	<li>Being thankful.</li>
	<li>Driving with windows down.</li>
	<li>Spending time with people you care about.</li>
</ul>

So really, I'm discovering much of life is all about perspective.  If you see things one way, you will have that attitude.  If you see it in a different light, your attitude will be completely different.  Choosing every day to see the brighter side is important I think.
