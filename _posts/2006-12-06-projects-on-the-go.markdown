I have to admit it.  I'm a doer.  As such, I need to have things going on just feel like I'm being productive.  Maybe it's not the greatest way to live, but alas that's me.  I was struggling to decide whether or not I should take on more stuff to do.  My housemate at the time (Kin) said, "you have time now, just do it".

Exam time is a great time of year.  If you work hard when you study, you can take time off to do other things. So here are some "fun" things that are on my plate.  Some I need to do, some are not as important:
<ul>
	<li><a title="Lips" onclick="doPopup(422);return false;" class="imagelink" href="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/lips.jpg"><img width="128" height="62" alt="Lips" id="image422" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/lips.thumbnail.jpg" /></a>Final Project.  My partner and I are trying to create a real-time (fast) algorithm to find and then track lips.  The hope is that we will have one that is robust enough to have a group next year take that information and turn it into real words.  Think automatic speech reading.  Anyways, we're not as far as we would have hoped so far but we have time now to work on it.  You can see in the above image that we are able to partially find the lips.  These are initial tests and it will have to refined quite a bit.</li>
	<li>Finding a job - It's true, I would like to make some $$$ once I finish.  There are a couple of places on the forefront and I'm pretty certain at least one of them will happen.  So it's not a huge priority to keep looking right now.  Sweet!</li>
	<li><a title="Clock" onclick="doPopup(423);return false;" class="imagelink" href="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/project-007.jpg"><img width="108" height="96" alt="Clock" id="image423" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/project-007.thumbnail.jpg" /></a> Hacking my alarm clock.  Inspired by <a href="http://hackaday.com/">hack-a-day</a>, I have been wanting to play with microcontrollers for awhile now.  I thought of a simple (simpler) project to start was to hack my alarm clock.  Instead of have the radio blaring at X time in the morning, wouldn't it be nice if the volume would ramp up?  That way, you'd be less surprised and automatically hit the snooze button and instead have a pleasant "reveille".  Maybe?  I dunno.  Anyways, I have the microcontrollers (free samples for Microchip), a breadboard, programmer and other fun stuff.</li>
	<li>Learning Morse Code - I'm not even kidding you.  Since I've started in amateur radio, it sounds like those who really appreciated the hobby knew "code" (also known as Continuous Wave or CW).  It's a crazy challenge that will take me a couple of months at the earliest.  Once I got it?  Many doors (in the hobby anyways) will open.</li>
</ul>
Back to studying!
