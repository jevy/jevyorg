IEEEEEE.  So it's time to pick classes etc.  Usually the most fun part of the year as you can highly optimize and pack classes as not to waste time.  So I'm taking five years of school right?  Well, the problem is, since I haven't finished all the third year classes, I'm not considered a fourth year student.  Whatever, I don't mind being at the same class of people who I've already taken most of their classes.  Problem is, until I finish the third year classes I can't take fourth year classes!!

... so, I was hoping that my nice guy skills would swoon the Engineering Admin Ladies:
Jevin: G'Afternoon ladies
Ladies: Hi!
Jevin: Blah blah blah.. fourth year.. not all courses done... blah blah blah... what do you guys recommend?
Ladies: See that orange piece of paper?  Go to that website, it's all online.

SHOOT!  How am I going to swoon a website.  Time to grovel in the "reason for exception" form.  Please pray. :S

<strong>UPDATE</strong>:  I am now in one of the very last slots to register: Aug 9 at 3pm.  IEEEEEEEEE
