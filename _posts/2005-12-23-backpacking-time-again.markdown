I just got this email from a guy I met at the hostel one evening in Zurich two summers ago.  He's from the west of Mexico.  We still email each other back and forth.  I think the keyboard he's always typed on has a stuck CAP LOCK:

<blockquote>
   HOW ARE YOU? TOO MUCH TIME WITHOUT COMUNICATION.
   HERE ALL IS FINE WITH MY LIFE NOT MUCH TO SAY.SAME WORK
   I HOPE TO KWOW SOMETHING ABOUT YOU?
   I WISH YOU MERRY CHRISTMAS AND GREAT 2006.
   YOUR FRIEND CESAR.
