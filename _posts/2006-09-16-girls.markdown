My mom said to me _out of the blue_: "I have no doubt you'll find a great girl".  "Whoa!" I said "thanks mom".  "You know, don't settle for a really nice girl.  Settle with nothing less than someone who is spectacular."

Somewhere deep inside, that made feel good.

P.S. Sorry for the lack of posts gang.  For whatever reason, I'm telling myself I can't post until my new website is done.
