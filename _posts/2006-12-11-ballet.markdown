A stack of us from Carleton went out to see the Nutcracker last night at the NAC.  I have to admit that I don't recall ever seeing a ballet before so I figured it would be a good way to get other there and become more cultured.  It was fun!  I enjoyed watching the kids in the audience with their "oohhhhh" and "ahhhhhhhh" reactions.  Anyways, I think Swan Lake is up next time ;)
