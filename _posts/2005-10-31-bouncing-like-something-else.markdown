I've gotten a couple of comments of people enjoying the random things I've been posting.  So here's another one I found from <a href="http://boingboing.net/">boingboing</a>.  250,000 bouncy balls in the streets of San Fran.  My favorite is the part is the froggie getting hit and having to jump away.  This one's of you Tristan.
