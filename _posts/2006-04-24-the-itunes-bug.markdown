What did I buy?  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekend_Players">Weekend Players</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008DKDC/qid=1145917789/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/702-5923932-6057658">Pursuit of Happiness</a>.  I knew a bunch of the tracks going in but the title track "Pursuit of Happiness" is fantastic.  A review that works well from Amazon:
<blockquote>"A great soundtrack for your drive to work, and a nice wind down for the ride home - sunny days only - windows down of course. This is definitely a cd that was meant to be played in the car, a soundtrack for warm sunny evenings driving home from the office - longing to be driving home from somewhere more exotic."</blockquote>
Similar artists to these guys are Zero 7, Everything but the Girl (I'm also a big fan of these guys).  It's sorta a jazzy CD with an electronic twist.  Check it out!

Word of caution about the iTunes store though: Turn off 1-click buy!  Eep!
