John was in many ways my engineering mentor.  He setup my first Linux box when I was in ninth grade.. it got hacked..  He gave me advice which Eng stream to join, gave me advice to volunteer with a prof which ended up landing me a sweet job.  He's now in Waterloo working on his Ph.D and came up (partially) to ring me at "The Ritual Calling"
