We did an outreach with "school of the prophetic" on the streets of Ottawa to simply be Jesus to people.  I looked at the sheet and saw that I was helping serve on the homeless team.  "Homeless team?" I thought "what the heck?  I want to chat with peeps in coffee shops or something!".</span>

Thursday night: Met with the team (mix of teens, adults and retired people) to just get a feel where people were at.  Had some incredible worship (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jevy/364976320/">pic</a>).

<strong>Friday night</strong>: People from various churches put together "survival packs" with sleeping bags and various stuff needed for the cold winter.  Some of the team took these packs to the streets to find people who might need them.  My half of the team went over to <a href="http://www.stgeorgesottawa.ca/">St. George</a>'s drop in centre with bags of clothes to give out.  We really wanted to meet people where they were at and simply hang out with them.  People were _sooo_ appreciative to have us there.
<blockquote>Jeff:  "Are you coming back next Friday?"

Jevin: "I dunno man, I'm an Orleans guy"

Jeff: "Oh okay, well, even for five minutes, if you want to hang, I'll be here".

Jevin: "You know, if I'm around.. I will!"</blockquote>
<strong>Saturday morning</strong>: Hit up the streets with some packs with -12 plus windchill.  I went with two older ladies down by the Shepards of Good Hope.  As I was walking, this guy runs across traffic (King Edward!) towards me:
<blockquote>Me: "Hey brother!"

Lee: "Hey!!  Are you giving stuff out?"

Me:  "Yeah!  I think this bag has your name on it!"

Lee:  "Nice!  Does it have gloves?"

Me:  "Let's see... yes!  Here ya go!  How about socks?  Whoa!  Furry insoles too!"

Lee:  "That's f***ing sweet!!  Thanks man!  Wow!"</blockquote>
I saw his later with the pack and his new mitts :D :D

<strong>Saturday afternoon</strong>:  This was awesome.  Insane even.  We as a team really just wanted to "bless the socks off" some homeless people and give them some dignity.  Four of us from the outreach took five guys to lunch with NO STRINGS ATTACHED!  These guys couldn't believe it!  It was an incredible experience just to see them really enjoy themselves.  The conversation was just so natural and free flowing.  It wasn't forced, it wasn't weird, just straight up fun.  For that moment, we all had something in common, enjoying community.  How awesome would it be if everyone, the wealthy and the poor, could have an incredible meal every night.

I didn't get to see any physical miracles or whatever, but I saw Christ's heart.  His heart from everyone.  Me, you everyone.  Wow.
Note: I lost about four days of pic-a-day pictures in an accidental camera format.  BOO!
