Never noticed this before but it looks like Adobe is working on a competitor for Apple's Aperture.  It's mainly designed for workflow stuff.  So, if you're someone that stakes stacks of photos of pictures at an event but feel it's too tedious to sort through all the pictures a delete all the crappy ones (ie the vast majority), play with this program.

Oh yeah.... it's free for now.  <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/lightroom/">Adobe Lightroom</a>.
