I'm stuck -- or so it feels like anyways.  Very few companies (that I've seen) will even talk to anyone who is not in co-op.  It's my fault for not applying last year and I called them up today and they say I cannot get into the program as I'm to far into the program.  I don't have the marks needed that will put me above the cut and I don't have the industry experience to land me most jobs.  So where do I go from here?

I've got my applications in a couple of places but now I'm really not feeling confident about this stuff.  Perhaps volunteering to do research for a professor or something?  Maybe even take classes this summer and try for a fall or winter placement somewhere?  Ugh...
