So I want to make a good impression on the Dean and his people so I went in today to meet the Dean's assistant and the secretaries.  Filled out some forms to be able to get some bling.
<blockquote>Anne: "Karen, this is Jevin, he's going to be working on the robot"
Jevin: "Not just the dance either" *Does a quick dance*
They laugh
Anne: "Hey!  Do you watch Dr. Who?"
Jevin: "No sorry I don't.."
Anne: "Man, I'm so angry the actor dies!  He was sooo good"
</blockquote>

Wow.. that was pretty dumb of me to do looking back on it.  As if I did the robot in front of the assistant to the Dean.  What happens if he wants me to do the robot for HIM!! AHHHHHHH.  I should practice just in case.
