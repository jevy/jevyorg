Well, the three of us moved into our new (well, 1930s new) place over the weekend.  It's going to be a blast I'm sure.  Things are slow to get organized.  Without the internet and phoneline there isn't too much to do in spare time (that's a complete lie really).  Between the CBC and CTV which we get on the antenna, I was forced to watch the budget ("Is there more?  MORE MORE!") being released after I got home from work.  Oh well.

Work is starting out pretty slow.  These first days are slow getting everything setup but I'm sure I'll be off to the races soon enough.  My team _is_ young and fun.  They're a funny bunch for sure.  This getting up at 6:35 every morning will take some getting used to though.  *le sigh*
