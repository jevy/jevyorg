I've taken plenty of blood tests that past couple of months.  My doc has been finding that in the past three of four tests in the past three months, my white blood cell count is unusually low.  I asked her what could be be the cause she nearly refuses to answer as it could be so many things.  I called my naturopath up and she's looking into it but agrees it could be any number of things.  Could it be related to this Candida thing?  Goodness knows.  I do know that the good Lord loves me and is taking care of me.  Anyways, I got a referral for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematologist">Hematologist</a>.
I'm crazy tired these days though.   I think I need to drink more water to flush my system... or something. :P
