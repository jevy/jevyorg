I was at a job interview a couple of weeks ago:
<blockquote>HR: So what are the main things you are looking for in a job when taking a job?

Me: Well, first and foremost the work has to be interesting.  Secondly, meeting the manager and finding out their management style as well as meeting the team to see if it will click.  After all that comes salary.

HR: *hestitaion* Okayyy.

Me: What?

HR: Nono.  That's fine.</blockquote>
Hummm.  Is this not a priority for taking a job or will people take whatever pays the best.  I guess I'm more of a quality of life guy.  The fact that the HR person was surprised by my response makes me think that this isn't a common answer.  No?
