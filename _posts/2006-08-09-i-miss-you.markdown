<blockquote>Time winds down as you stretch upward to heaven
His blood resounds as it's not over precursor
They'll paint them red, those things you said.
They'll paint them red, what you said.

I miss you. I miss you
And I miss you
I need you. I need you
And I need you more
Can see you. I see you
Can I see you now?  -- <a href="http://www.plyrics.com/lyrics/acceptance/seeingisbelieving.html">Seeing is Believing</a> - <a href="http://www.acceptancerock.com/">Acceptance</a></blockquote>
