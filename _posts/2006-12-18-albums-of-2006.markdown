This was a big music year for me.  I discovered iTunes which has been both a blessing and a curse. I'm finding I feel better about life not having to download from "grey area" sources and can legally get my music at reasonable prices.  Here on my favorite albums from the year.  Some (most) may not be released this year, but I only recently discovered them.  If you have more recommendations, by all means, leave a comment.
<ul>
	<li><img width="96" height="96" id="image431" alt="Weekend Players" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/b00008dkdc01_aa240_sclzzzzzzz_.thumbnail.jpg" /> Weekend Players - Pursuit of Happiness - These guys have been remixed to kingdom come.  After loving "Higher Ground" on <a href="http://m1live.com">Music One</a> all the time, I fell in love and had to buy it.  What a joy that was.  I'm still boppin' my head to "Pursuit of Happiness" for months now.  Unfortunately, these guys have been out of commission for awhile now.  Come back!  Anyways, if you like phat beats and smooth vocals, check it out.</li>
	<li><img width="96" height="96" id="image430" alt="Charlie Brown" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/charlie.thumbnail.jpg" />Charlie Brown's Christmas - Probably my most memorable Christmas show.  I love the music and can sympathize with my man Charlie Brown.  I saw this one at Starbucks but it was selling for $20!  When I got home, got it on iTunes for something like $7.99.  Awesome!  I should really find out when this is on this holiday.</li>
	<li><img width="96" height="96" id="image432" alt="Plumb" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/b000agtqg801_aa240_sclzzzzzzz_.thumbnail.jpg" />Plumb - Chaotic Resolve - I was shopping at Blessings and sure enough this one was on the wall.  I listened to it and bought it immediately.  Plumb has an incredible ability to capture moments and can really paint a wonderful picture.  She mixes in some beats with moving lyrics.  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=LEGoHi5HDn0">Cut</a> is one of my faves.  Oh yeah, and she has the <a href="http://jevy.org/2006/08/05/stolen-fury/">coolest name</a> for her kid.</li>
	<li><img id="image433" alt="Feist" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/b00092qrh401_aa192_sclzzzzzzz_.thumbnail.jpg" /> Feist - Let it Die.  Who was this that recommended this to me?  Anyways, Feist is just plenty fun.  Emotional and catchy.  I'd highly recommend it if you like more accousticy, cute, mellow stuff.</li>
	<li><img width="96" height="96" id="image434" alt="Sigur" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/b00006llnu01_aa240_sclzzzzzzz_.thumbnail.jpg" /> Sigur Ros - () - I bought this before heading down to New York and discovered this to be the perfect night flight music.  The whole CD is subtle, gentle and easily immerses you into another place.  Very chill time for bed (or out of bed) music.</li>
	<li><img width="96" height="96" id="image435" alt="BT" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/b000g8oz1601_aa240_sclzzzzzzz_v39659554_.thumbnail.jpg" /> BT - Binary Universe - This one's still under the tree but since I own all but one of BT's CD and love 'em.  I'm sure this will be no different.  The reviews on Amazon look awesome.  Even comes with a DVD with 7 music video which some say is even better than the CD itself.  It's coming soooon.</li>
