title: Walmart, Ebay and Mom&#038;Pop Down the Street

The vast majority of the stuff that I buy (other than groceries and gas) is done online.  Some of my favorite retailers are places like <a href="http://www.ebay.ca">ebay </a>and <a href="http://directcanada.com">directcanada</a>.  Just yesterday I bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripboard">stripboard </a>set from the UK for 1/3 the price I would at the local electronics store and today I bought an external soundcard online for about 25% off the local store.

It's got me thinking about how this type of thing affects the local mom & pop shops and my own moral responsibility on buying from them vs "the man" type stores.  The internet has done tons to help build competition between businesses.  Since you're no longer limited to having to order from the store down the street or even the single catalog that you get in the mail quarterly, you can buy from any fly-by-night wholesaler that just opened last night.  What does this mean for the electronics store down the road?  Well, certainly they'll have less business and will in turn make less money.  So what should I do about it?  That's a fantastic and huge question.

I'm really glad I took that "Philosophy of social, moral and religious" class back in third year.  It really helped my learn how to round out my perspectives and try to balance them out based on my own beliefs etc.  I don't have answers, but it's worth thinking about.

On a more serious note, time to watch "Snakes on a Plane".
