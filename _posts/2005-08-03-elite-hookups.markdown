Why is it that celebraties only hook up with celebrities?  Is it that  the famous class has all the really nice and ambitious people that have the ability to raise a family?  Or is it that they simply don't associate with any of the not-so-famous class after they get rich?  Reason I ask is I saw Sheryl Crow with her boyfriend Lance Armstrong on Oprah (not that I know.. err... watch).
