Holy crap.  I Skyped up Chan to ask about some equations for Quantum I didn't get:

<blockquote>
Jevy: Hey man.  What's the S.E equation and solution for tunnelling?
Bew: I don't know man.  I'm studying networking.
Jevy: Whoa!  You feel that good about Quantum that you can study for tomorrow's exam when we have Quantum today?
Bew: WHAT???  We have Quantum tomorrow!
Jevy: WHAT?!!??!?! Quantum's today!  Stop lying
Bew: No man..
Jevy: WHAT?!?!  I'm sweating everywhere. AHHHHHH
Bew: AHHHH I'm shaking for you.  Let's go to school.  I'll teach you everything!
Jevy: AHHHHHHHH
.. and here we are. With two hours before an exam I'm barely studied for.  WHAAA
</blockquote>

<strong>Update</strong>:  Turned out to be fine.  Now I'm ready for tomorrow's exam :)  I think God lead me to talk to Chan today.  Otherwise I would have been stinking lost
