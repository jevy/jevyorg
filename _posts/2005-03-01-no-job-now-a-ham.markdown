Forgot to post this last week.  Oops:

<blockquote>Just a got a letter in the mail from <a href="http://ipunwired.com/">IPunwired</a> saying I didn't get the job.  This really stinks since I really felt I fit the position really well.  I think it was my marks that hurt me.  When it really comes down to the competition I think they'd take an A over my B+.

In other news, I passed my HAM test today.  I am now on a new level of geekness! lol.  I passed with an 81% when I was actually worried of failing (needing a 60%) since I really wasn't feeling good about my answers.  I now have to figure out what stuff I want to get involved in.  Assuming I have time :S</blockquote>
