I'm not a fan of a) being bored and b) the same 'ol stuff.  I came to this realization not too long ago trying to plan an evening with a bunch of people who really weren't interested (that day) to expend some energy and do some great stuff.  (Sidenote: I was recruiting to skate the whole canal on the first day it was open, then go out for desert and jazz once we got to the end.  Common!).  Anyways, so I got mopey around the house and decided maybe I should just rent a movie.  I then realized how stupid that was since I would have been the one not putting in the effort.

Anyways, turned out we went to a friends' place.  Sat on a freezer in a kitchen, got poked for the duration, ate baked goods as they were coming out of the oven, played Starcraft (I really suck), and split a pitcher with a good buddy and got home way to late!

Had a blast...  maybe the less organized times are the better ones? Nah...

I really can't complain though.  I got semi-rebuked by a pastor last year.  "Some people would kill for two people they could call good friends".  Shoot.  Have a great week folks!
