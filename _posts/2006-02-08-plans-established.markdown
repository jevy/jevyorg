That's it then.  I got a call last night for a job position in the city and I have taken them up on it.  In a brief moment my hopes for spending another summer in Europe were dashed.  I am trusting that this is what I'm supposed to do this summer.  It's going to be a pretty sweet job I'm sure.
That summer I had an absolute blast with the people who were here.  My heart wants to "re-create" that experience but I realize that will just be setting myself up for dissapointment.  Instead, I look forward to new summer filled with roadtrips, new adventures and lots of Ultimate.  Wh00p wh00p

Oh yeah.. and NYC for a couple of days of "Reading Week"
