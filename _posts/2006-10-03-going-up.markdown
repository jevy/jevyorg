<p>So in the past couple of months, my energy and health has really taken a huge hit.  Finally decided to do something about it and checked out a <a href="http://ottawasouthnaturopath.ncf.ca/">reputable Naturopath</a> in the city.  Went in and did some tests.  Turns out she thinks that good number of my symptoms are caused by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_gut">Leaky Gut</a>.  Frankly, my doctor gives me ideas on stuff I can do to treat the symptoms but really has no idea the cause.  If someone thinks they know the root, bring it on.</p>
<p>So anyways, to add to my list of old food allergies (corn, milk, MSG) she added yeast and wheat.  HOLY CRAP!  The great thing though?  It's temporary, once I get the right bacteria balance again I should be doing much better and many of my allergies (even dogs and cats?) should get significantly better.  Whattttttttt.  Anyways, she says give it a couple of months and we'll see how things go.</p>
<p>Weird way for God to heal me perhaps?
