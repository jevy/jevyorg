Saturday my friends Tara and Maria (from <a href="http://www.carletoncc4c.ca">Crusade</a> at Carleton) graduated so a couple of us headed down to Alumni park for the Convocation.  As I was flipping through the Convocation program, I saw <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jevy/20367549/">this</a>.  Holy crap!  I went up to him before the next convocation service and said hi.  He was super suprised to see me and was genuinely interested to hear how everyone was doing.

Some of us went downtown with Tara and her family (from PEI) to show them around the city.  She's the eldest of eleven kids!!!  _only_ six siblings were there on Saturday but that was enough for me.  The were super excited to just be downtown and two of them wanted to hold my hand and jump all over me the entire time.  Now, you must understand this is new to me.  I can't remember much of that happening in my family way back when.  I mean, my brother and I wrestled and stuff with dad but holding hands?  I must admit I enjoyed it, they were looking for security and attention from me and it was awesome.  I also have to say that I was absolutely drained by the end of it.  I was falling asleep on the couch with one of the kids (5 years old) wanting me to "fight him" outside.
