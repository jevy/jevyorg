I think it's only starting to hit me that school won't be starting up again in the next couple of months and that I could potentially end up in the same organization for years and years (goodness knows some people here have been).  I've been looking around the past month to try to find a niche I'm interested in pursuing.  It's still quite overwhelming and the politics between departments could make anyone's head spin (no doubt this no different than any other large organization).  Some days are lonely with no one really around to have breaks with as my department is _actually_ busy with real work (which is nice!).  Some days my break consists of a walk outside the office door, looking both ways down the hallway, a stretch and I'm back to work.  *Bleh*

Really.. I can't complain and I'm not.  I just wish we had more nerf guns to kill time.  I'm too tired to proof read this so maybe you guys can for me :D :D
