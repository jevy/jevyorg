So Jack's Mannequin got to me.  In high school I made a CD every month to put play in the Escort with my killer sound system.  Since, I haven't really made those types of musical collections since and it is something I miss, I was thinking I could trade with people.  How about it, if you make me a mix tape (compile as an ISO?), I'll send you one.  How does that sound?
