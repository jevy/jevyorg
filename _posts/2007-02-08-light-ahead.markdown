So it's a week or so before reading week and everything is piling up.  For the first time though, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, magically giving me energy to push ahead.  I was talking to a friend from high school today who said the first and last semesters of school are always the hardest.  Somehow it makes me feel better to have someone to relate to.

Ugh essays.
