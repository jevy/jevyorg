Well to be honest, I didn't think my school cared about anything.  Turns out they do.  Wether or not they are willing to show their face for their personal beliefs is a different story.  We probably had a showing of 70 at the 1:45pm event and probably 150 in the evening.  Many of us were prepared for riots if the forums were any indication of what was going to happen last night.  Turned out everyone was really respectful and genuinely curious.  We had a suprise visit from Pastor Reed (probably one of the most well respected pastors in the city) who was able to sit on the panel both evenings and had some incredible answers.

I know of a bunch of people who want to sit down and talk about their views with people and hear about what the bible has to say about God.

I pretty certain that the vast majority of people who are posting on the forums against the "in your face" advertising are really not offended by some chalk on the sidewalk or a bunch of posters on the way to class, but are more angry with the message of <a href="http://www.iagreewithpercy.com/whoisjesus.php">Jesus Christ</a>.  How do I know this?  I've probably been stopped by about 5 people in the halls and people ask "hey!  What's this all about?  I've seen it everywhere!"  Are they hostile?  No!  They're genuinely curious about what it's about.  If they were angry about the advertising they would have said so without haven't heard what it's actually about.

There's been over 52000 page views on the website.  Mind you, probably about 40000 are reads in the forums but still!  There are some good conversations in there.  Some really stooped though: posting everything from Porn to slandering Percy boy.  Pretty lame stuff.  We were going to close up the forum but I think most of the problems have been solved.
