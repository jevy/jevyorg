Showed up in Montreal with a friend of mine Jeff.  I have a bunch of friends on a Campus Crusade missions project here so I came up to visit.  Problem is, they all work during the day so they weren't super excited about going out in the evening.  I guess that's my bad for coming down mid-week.  My ride was going back this morning but I'm not super keen on going back to Ottawa just yet, I just want to sick around.  I hope I'll find some quality stuff to check out.

As much as I would like to meet people today, I would be content simply walking around.  I'll be back in Ottawa tonight or maybe tomorrow.  No idea.
