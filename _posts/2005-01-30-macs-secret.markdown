Frosters from Mac's Milk are one of my favorite late night snacks okay?  So legend has it (and I'm not sure who told me) that there is a guy who works nights at the Mac's by my place who has his Engineering degree and _they_ knew someone who went there to get homework help at like 3am.   So on my way home I often grab one and happen to ask: "are you the engineer guy?".  Teh first guy I asked replied saying that he has his law degree and studying his masters.  The guy I asked tonight said he has his accounting degree.  He did say however, that his manager for the store downtown used to be an engineering prof in Syria!!!  What the heck?  Are they not able to find jobs or is there some crazy money in these stores that I just don't see..
