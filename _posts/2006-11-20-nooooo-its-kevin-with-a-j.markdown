Since Facebook is really picking up, I decided to see how many people with the name "Jevin" were on there.  Turns out there's a bunch of us.  So naturaly, last night I started a facebook support group and invited all the Jevin's.  By tonight?  21 people have joined the group "Nooooo... It's Kevin with a J".  The coolest thing?  They're from all different cultures!!  Brown, Black, Latino and White (I'm sure some Asians will pop by soon).  Here are some of the comments on the discussion board:
<blockquote>Jevin 1: "I thought I was the only one with this name. XD"

Jevin 2: "oh s*** me too, and I have to introduce myself like that ALL the time!"

Jevin 3: "I thought, i am the only one who has to explain everone "It's Kevin with a J"... nice to meet u guys here...."

Jevin 4: "I have waited so long for some one to share my pain of having to say "its kevin with a J" damn how hard is it to say jevin"

Jevin 5: "Our names confuse people with 1 simple letter... bahahaha"</blockquote>
