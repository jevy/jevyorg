I can't imagine working 9-5.  I've got four "8:30s" this week and finish at 5:30 for two of them.  Now that I'm writting it down, it doesn't sound as bad as maybe what I'm making it out to be.  Anyways, it's ruining me.

I'm in trouble once my "real" job starts this summer.  100% props to those nine to fivers out there
