Plumb named her kid Solomon Fury Lee.  I have never heard such a powerful name and I feel as though she stole the name of my (future) kid.  Despite her thinking of it first.

Just checked out her website and there is a MAD MAD MAD danceable version of "cut" on her site.  <a href="http://www.plumbinfo.com">GO NOW</a> AND TURN IT UP LOUD LOUD LOUD.  It's got me going and it's only freakin' 10:38am in the morning!! HAZAAAHHHHHHHH
