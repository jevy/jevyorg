It's been a long time since I've been to the gym.  Since I have some free time in the next month, I thought I'd get started into it again.  Ironically, after having a free gym available at school, and only finishing school, I'm going starting to work out at a gym I'm paying for.  So I got myself a nice 45 year old personal training showing me the ropes (err machines) and set me up with a schedule.  Three times a week baby.  Yipes!

I should be fun though, I feel so good after I've spent an hour doing it.
