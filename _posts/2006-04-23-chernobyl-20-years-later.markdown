I have almost been facinated by the Chernobyl disaster.  I'm not sure why really.  Maybe how a split second can have devistating effects for hundreds of years.  Maybe I just like ghost towns.  There are websites and photoblogs posted all over the place for the 20th anniversary of the disaster.  I've blogged <a href="http://www.kiddofspeed.com/chapter1.html">this site</a> before which is the best I've seen.  One that <a href="http://www.pixelpress.org/chernobyl/index.html">I just spotted</a> on boingboing is good.  Warning: Graphic.
