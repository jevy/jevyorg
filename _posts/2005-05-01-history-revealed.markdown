So Grandma stayed at our plaec for a couple of days this week so I was finally able to ask her a bit about my heritage.  So here is the final results *tadda!*:

50% - Maltais - French Canadian (from France).  Still have to figure out which generation
25% - Davidson - Scottish - 5th or 6th generation
25% - Kinney - Irish - Likely 5th generation

I'm glad I finally know this.  So I am now taking invitations to join a french/irish/scottish mafia somewhere.  Please address them to Jevin.

I also found out the names of my grandma's uncles who died from the gas in Ypres: Bob and Nelson Davidson.
