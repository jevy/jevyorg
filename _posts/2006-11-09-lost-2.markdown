Yesterday the semi-season finale.  I cannot get over how crazy this show is.  It's frustrating how they designed it to be addictive where you simply cannot guess anything right.  Why do I like it so much despite this?  Good stinking question.  If you don't keep up with the show -- don't start.  You need to watch _every episode_ to know what the crap is going on.

Very very well done show though if you have days on end to catch up.  Mind you, it's only back in February.
