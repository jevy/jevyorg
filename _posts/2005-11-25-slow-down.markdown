title: Slow down!!!

Instead of simply sitting and listening to another music CD on the bus, I've been searching for books/podcasts that will keep me "productive" on the bus.  Music is great on the bus, don't get me wrong but when you're on the bus for two hours a day, I think I can spend it better.

So anyways, for half an hour a day, I'm going to try to listen to Dr. Dobson's Focus on the Family.  He's a Psychologist from the States.  It's a quality program for sure!  The reason I post this is that Wednesday's program was great: "Slow down and Enjoy Life".  A pretty solid message even if Christianity isn't your deal.  <a href="http://boss.streamos.com/download/swn/saved/oneplace/ministries/ffd/mp3/free/ffd20051123.mp3?siteid=PodCast">Here's the MP3</a>.
