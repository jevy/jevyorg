I played squash with my long time from from first year Mr. Brian Darvell.  I knew full well thatme  playing against a dude who frequents the squash courts and runs 5kms three times a week would be a terrible sight (as I haven't done much physical activity since August I'm sure).  I don't expect many people to know this guy but he's got a pretty swell website.  Brian:
<ul>
	<li>.. has taught himself Jazz piano</li>
	<li>.. reads tons (or so his website suggests)</li>
	<li>.. cites his web site posts with the IEEE standard</li>
	<li>.. was in my ALSS (Applied Language for Engineers) class.</li>
	<li>.. has notes about <a target="_blank" href="http://darvell.ca/Articles/Finite%20Element%20Methods%20-%20Notes.pdf">The Fundamentals of Finite Element Analysis</a> on his website</li>
	<li>.. is a long time jevy.org fan (or so he says ha).</li>
</ul>
Anyways.. check out <a href="http://darvell.ca/">his site</a>!  Interesting stuff.
