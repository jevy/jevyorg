This one is an original from Carleton's Christian Catholic Outreach's <a href="http://jevy.org/wp-admin/cco.ca/meetstaff/krisdmytrenko.htm">Kris D</a>.  Now, many people have seen him around either in the Chaplaincy sipping cup 'o soups or giving out popcorn at the outreach tables.  But do you really know Kris?  This might give some insight:
