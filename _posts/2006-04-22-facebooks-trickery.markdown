So I got a Facebook account the other day since someone asked me "soo what's your facebook account?" obviously assuming that I already had one because a) I'm at university b) I was alive.

I've given it a couple of weeks but Dave <a href="http://luongsass.blogspot.com/2006/04/facebook.html">beat me</a> to the chase.  It's totally an ego booster.  Why is it that a girl from high school, who graduated a year after me, who's brother I hung out with in elementary school added me as a "friend".  Initially when I saw this, I was happy to have another "friend".  What?  How am I a friend to this person, I talked to them maybe twice in my life.  So really, what is the point of listing people as friends.  Kev posted a great link <a href="http://www.kevlam.net/2006/03/27/trendspotting-myspace/">here </a>to an evaluation of the new "social networking" scene.
I personally feel it's an ego booster.  Why else would the front page of my login say: "You are connected to 4361 people through your networks."  Yehaw!  I'm the most popular guy ever!  Yeah right..

So I'm off to bed.. after I check for new messages on facebook.
