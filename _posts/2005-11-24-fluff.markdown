So it's snowing 10cm today.  I'm really torn about how I feel about it.  Snow itself is pretty cool.  My favorite is snow sitting on trees stacked up really high.  I also just want to pat snow down with my hand just to feel the fluffiness.  When I walk home from the 95 late on a Friday or Saturday night, I like to take my headphones off and just listen to the *crunch crunch* and *squeek squeek* until my feet.  With a bit of wind and the street lights?  Oh yeahhhhhhh

.. on the flip side, snow reminds me OF -40 PLUS WINDCHILL WAITING FOR THE BUS AT 7:20 IN THE MORNING HOLY CRAP HOLY CRAP HOLY CRAPPPPPPP!  Eventhough it never seems to snow when it gets that cold.  Weird..

.. but other than that... snow is good times..
