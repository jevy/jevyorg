Well I've spent 10 hours on the same freakin' problem on my QNX development system with no luck.  I have a headache and I just want to take a nap.  Putting my heart and soul in my project will be awesome once I get a system working that I can actually start to work on.

I'm just ranting.

Oh yeah!  On a good note, internet's showing up at my place on Friday.  Nicceeeee
