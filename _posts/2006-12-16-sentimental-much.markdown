In the past couple of days I've hunted down a stack of friends from elementary school on Facebook.  Memories came flooding back of the simpler days.  This got me thinking:  I find that with most people in my life, I'm the one that tends to try to keep relationships alive or at the very least, try to maintain a certain amount of contact.  Maybe I live in the past, maybe I have a heard time visualizing the future.  For whatever reason, memories that I have cherish to the nth degree.

Sometimes I think that other people don't do the same or don't even care about the times we had together.  A good example was our "high school reunion" months back.  Now, it wasn't a real high-school reunion, but I love any opportunity to see old teachers and friends that you had back in the day to just talk about stuff from before.  I'm trying to hate on people for not coming, but I was _the only one_ from my class (that's <a href="http://fios.livejournal.com/">Jay </a>for showing up when I was leaving lol).  Anyways, just some thoughts.
