Hey gang!  Well, I always thought it would be a cool idea about reading the bible from start to finish so I found the "One Year Bible" in my basement that my mom bought when she became a Christian like twenty some years ago.  Anyways, I just started the daily reading and I think it would be cool to get a community going of a bunch of people doing the same.  You know, encourage each other and keep each other accountable.  You obviously don't have to a Christian to do this, in fact I think it would be great to have different perspectives during the year.  The commitment is probably 15 minutes a day of reading.

So, starting January 1st for all interested, we'll have a a blog online that we can all contribute too.  Ask for it for Christmas!

Email me or leave a comment if you're interested.
