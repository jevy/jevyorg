This marks the first day of summer for me.  Tomorrow I will make a general plan of what I want to do this summer.  That way, I can motivate myself to get out of bed in the mornings.  I'll post it once it gets done.

Went out with Mel, Gen, Jay L, Jay P, and James tonight.  Great to see people.  Looking forward to seeing even more people when people are around or not at Broadway's ;)
