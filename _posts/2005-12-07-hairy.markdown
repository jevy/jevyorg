So a bunch of us are growing the "exam beard".  Now, I haven't had facial hair since first year and I now remember why.  It's stinking gross!  I don't mind a little stubble after 3 days of not shaving.  But man, a week and some?  Ewwie

When I was doing Toronto project, three summers ago (holyyyyyy)  I had a decent goat with a 'stache.  That in itself was okay.  I asked the receptionist at work (who wasn't much older then I was) what she'd do if I just had the mustache.  She said she wouldn't talk to me.  I shaved off the goatee the next morning and sure enough, she wouldn't even look at me.  It was gone the next day.

Anberlin - Ready fuels has been stuck in my head for the past two days.   Giddy up!

Your arm in mine here near midnight and it feels so right
Girls and the boys chase down running hard tonight</blockquote>

Me: "Arghhhhh.."
