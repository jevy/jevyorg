So, I really love photography.  I'm really not sure why.  Maybe it's because I'm a tad (okay.. really) sentimental and just love to capture and remember great moments.  Maybe it's trying to push myself to look at life in a different way, to just slow down and to appreciate things.  With the internet, there are literally thousands of quality pictures that are posted everyday.  So many in fact, that I find myself click click clicking through all of them just to make sure I get through them all.  Problem with that is you can't really appreciate anything.

If you're looked through my <a href="http://jevy.org/gallery">photoblog/gallery</a>, you may have noticed I have few pictures of people!  .. and it kills me.  I'm so afraid of taking pictures of people and them seeing and thinking I'm a stalker or something.  I'm amazed when I see pictures of <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr </a>or other sites where people are obvious and amazing candid shots are captured.  Maybe I just need a 500mm telephoto lens so that I can capture people a kilometre away?  Anyways, there is just so much to this hobby that I think it's a just a matter of getting out there and doing it.  Maybe I need a photo buddy.  There's gotta be people from <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/35034360698@N01/">Ottawa </a>who want to get together.  Just two other people say.
