K... I have to be honest and say that I don't think that electronic organizers will ever work for me.  I've been using paper agendas ever since I traded my Palm Pro to my buddy James for a bag of BBQ Doritos in grade.. err.. 11?

Anyways, so I really want to get a moleskine for myself.  I think it would be significantly better than the propaganda driven agendas they give us at school.  Specifically, this baby <a href="http://www.moleskines.com/klmc517w.html">here</a>.  The problem?  Comes to $40 on ebay.  Ugh..
