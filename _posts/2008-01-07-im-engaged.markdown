So I was going to post this on my blog first but it seems that many of the people already found out via Facebook.

I proposed to my lovely girlfriend at 8:20pm on Friday, January 4th, 2007.  We had gone out for dinner at Baton Rouge, walked about for a bit.  I said "hey!  Let's get these nice people to take a picture of us at the eternal flame (my dad corrected me in that it's the Centennial Flame)".  I walked over to the other side where this lady and her husband were standing.  As I reached into my jacket to get the camera the wife got really nervous.  I then (quietly) explained that I was about to propose to my girlfriend and asked if they could take a picture.  "Wow" she said "how exciting".  So I went back and pulled the ring and got some lovely snaps at the same time.  The husband shook my hand twice and they both said how it made their evening to be part of this.

Anyways, it was fun.
