So I started work yesterday morning.  It's nice to sit down and feel like you're contributing to the world somehow (the money's nice too).  My manager showed me around, gave me an overview of the organization and the team and took me out for lunch.

I don't want to brag.. but working for the federal government rules.  ;)
