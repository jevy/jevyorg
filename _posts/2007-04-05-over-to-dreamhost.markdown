So, I'm trying to get away from the server in my basement.  I simply don't have the interest or energy to keep up with the latest updates for various packages I have on my Linux box.  Really, all it does is host the website and connect to the printer.  Both can be done fairly easily without a dedicated computer.  So anyways, jevy.org is now going to be hosted at Dreamhost (for now)!

That computer is pretty loud in the basement anyways.  Good riddance.
