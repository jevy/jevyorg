So my brother calls me from Orleans on Wednesday: "Internet's down".  I figure it's a power outage problem and it will be back sometime soon.  Sunday rolls around and it's still not back yet so I call up <a href="http://www.istop.com">istop</a>.
<blockquote>
Jevin: Hi!  Could I speak with tech support please?
Lady: Umm.. what about?
Jevin: Ummmm well... internet's been down since Wednesday and it looks fine on my end
Lady: Yeahhhhh.... Bell cut us off so we got bought out by Cybersurf.  So you'll need to change your user name and password.  Except to be back online in the next 1-5 business days.
Jevin: Really?  Wow... okay.. let me know the info.
</blockquote>

I glad they let me know these things.  Turns out I get a call from the Cybersurf guy on Monday explaining the situation and what to do.  Weird!  Check out their <a href="http://istop.com/news.html">news</a> section.  They sound bitter and understandably so.
