This video decided my fate for Co-pres in grade 12.  I'm actually really glad that I didn't win as maybe Craig S wasn't the best choice for a partner.  How come no one slapped me for this before hand?!!?

Anyways, the CJ (vote Craig and Jevin) video is online.  It's actually really bad.  I still have the T-Shirt in my closet.  Saw it yesterday ;)
