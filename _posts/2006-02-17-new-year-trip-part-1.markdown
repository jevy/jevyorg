Got to the airport nice and early at 11:30am to get on my plane for 2pm (hummm 13 minutes ago).  Flight cancelled.  Not surprising the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/02/17/weather060217.html">state of Ottawa right now</a>.  Sat on the line at a payphone in our bright shiny new airport for 45 minutes listening to the same music over.. and over.. and over.  Every 10 minutes the lady would come on: "Sorry Mr. Malt-eh-iz but it's really taking awhile for the new reservation to go through".  I really didn't mind, I'm flying out tonight at 7pm through Washington then to NYC.  More time to sit around.

<strong>Lesson #1:</strong>  Check to if your plane is in fact leaving and save three hours.
Canada's beating the US in the olympics, making me very happy to be going to the States right now :)
