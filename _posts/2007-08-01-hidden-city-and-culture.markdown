A continuing theme in my mind is "culture".  Really though, what does it mean to be cultural?  Does it mean you know the indie music scene?  Like to eat at the latest restaurants?  Know the most happening hot spots?  I think the root issue is that I what to really seize every moment to it's maximum.  Where would this idea come from?  Frankly, I think the media has a large part to do with it.  Being fed materialism at every corner, and TV shows where people are doing cool things _all the time_.  I can't believe I'm buying into this stuff!

In any case, at work I've been listening to CBC radio two.  Knowing classical music is culture right?  Something like that anyways.    As I don't know much about classical music I figure it will give me an opportunity to gain some exposure.  Tonight though, I sat down on my bed to listen to a CBC radio one program called <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/programguide/program/index.jsp?program=Hidden+City">Hidden City</a>.  I wish I could get the podcast but basically they look at the every day life of urbanites and issues related to them.  Tonight for example the host interviewed people on the street about why people avoid eye contact.  Cool!  Anyways, I recommend y'all check it out.
