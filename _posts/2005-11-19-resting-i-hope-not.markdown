Okay, second post in half an hour..

Man, I think I post about how much being at home on the weekend sucks everytime I'm stuck at home on a saturday.  I'm really having a hard time these days knowing that God's calling me to a time a resting.  What does that mean?  I'm still trying to figure that out.  It feels like things have slowed down in a life to a large degree.  For about two months I've been itching to get moving again.. you know a big project or something else to jsut sink my teeth into and really make progress in life.  It's looking as though, I'm supposed to just sit, and wait.  I'm realizing that resting is probably the most difficult thing that I _could_ be doing right now as it's really counter my personality.  Soooooooo yeah... I think I'm going to read Billy Graham's autobiography a bit.. maybe pray a bit.. study a bit and watch TV.  Maybe ALL AT ONCE!!!!!!!  Actually.. writing that out doesn't make it sound so bad!  Nice..
