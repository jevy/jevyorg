Well, as of this time tomorrow I'll be living downtown.  Super excited to get out of Orleans for awhile.  Went to see <a href="http://www.teaparty.com/">The Tea Party</a> last night for the <a href="http://www.tulipfestival.ca/">Tulip festival</a>.  I can't say they're one of my favorite bands but I can certainly appreciate their stuff!  The crowd was a mixed bag: high school prep boys looking to starts fight in the mosh pit, couples making out randomly in front of us, girls crying in the arms of their guy during various songs etc etc.

My friend Jer Phan posted some sweet tips for MSN people which I did this morning.  Very nice:
<blockquote>
Do not use MSN without the following:

    * MsgPlus [enhancements]: www.msgplus.net
    * Removing the advertisements: <a href="http://www.mastaline.com/?pagina=msn/downloadinfo&id=45">MSN 7 Patcher</a> [the site's in German, but the program's in English.]
    * click on the "Customer Improvement" bar at the top, then select "No" to get rid of it.
