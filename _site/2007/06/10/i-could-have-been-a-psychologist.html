<p>.. actually, there is no way I could have. When I was thinking about going to university, I was seriously considering taking Psychology for my degree. When I attended a &#8220;Mini-University&#8221; course in ninth grade, I was awe struck when scientists could train pigeons to eat a seed whenever a light came on by simply making the association between turning on a light and giving them food. Then, if you turn on the light and not give them food, they&#8217;ll still go for it. BRILLIANT! But alas, computers took over my life and I decided on Computer Engineering which probably worked out for the best.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve watched Super Nanny twice this weekend and have to say that I&#8217;m actually on the edge of my seat as I&#8217;m watching it. These kids are absolutely amazing manipulators. At four years old they already know what buttons to push to get their parents angry or what to do to stay up later. How do they learn this without anyone specifically telling them &#8220;if you do X, the result is Y&#8221;. Amazing how our brain was designed to adapt to situations even without any prior experience. Just put someone in a situation and they&#8217;ll learn to adapt to that culture (buzz word: socialization?). Fascinating stuff.</p>
