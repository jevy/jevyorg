<p>I think it&#8217;s only starting to hit me that school won&#8217;t be starting up again in the next couple of months and that I could potentially end up in the same organization for years and years (goodness knows some people here have been). I&#8217;ve been looking around the past month to try to find a niche I&#8217;m interested in pursuing. It&#8217;s still quite overwhelming and the politics between departments could make anyone&#8217;s head spin (no doubt this no different than any other large organization). Some days are lonely with no one really around to have breaks with as my department is <em>actually</em> busy with real work (which is nice!). Some days my break consists of a walk outside the office door, looking both ways down the hallway, a stretch and I&#8217;m back to work. <em>Bleh</em></p>

<p>Really.. I can&#8217;t complain and I&#8217;m not. I just wish we had more nerf guns to kill time. I&#8217;m too tired to proof read this so maybe you guys can for me :D :D</p>
