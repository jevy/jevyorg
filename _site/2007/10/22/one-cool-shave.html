<p>So I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;m sick of the Mach 3 and disposable razors. They are so expensive and don&#8217;t even give that great of a shave! So I went on Ebay and got myself a razor, a strop (it&#8217;s spelled right), and a badger hair brush (I have yet to find quality unscented cream). Anyways, my buddy (Arjun) and I both decided it would be a worth while investment.</p>

<p>After a week of playing with my new toy and nearly slicing my jugular (not actually), Arjun and I both thought it was be good to learn from the best! Who better than an Italian barber to teach us how to do things right. So Saturday afternoon we did just that. He barber actually shaved me twice! The first with a straight blade that uses a disposable razor blade, and the second time with my razor. All for a total of $8 + tip! Awesome!</p>
