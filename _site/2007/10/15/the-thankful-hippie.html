<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to focus on being more grateful for things in my life. There always seems to be something wrong and I am finding it&#8217;s really easy to become focussed on that problem. I decided a few weeks back that I would focus on the good in life and the things that are going well! What a difference! Being thankful for a job, for a warm (and cozy) bed, some great friends, for a relationship with my Maker, for the food I eat. This list really does go on.</p>

<p>Sometimes though, we all get to a point where we feel we&#8217;re getting the short end of the stick. What then? Well.. at least I have breath.</p>

<p>So anyways, it seems that this being thankful thing is making me more conscience about the world around me. From relationships, to the environment. I&#8217;m finding I am becoming more environmentally conscience, organic food aware and more easy going. It&#8217;s really weird!</p>
