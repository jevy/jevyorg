<p>So what does it mean when I have no email in my inbox? It means I have replied to everyone, and wrote down in my agenda all that&#8217;s left to do. What a great feeling! My email isn&#8217;t gone forever though, it&#8217;s just all archived. It&#8217;s truly a discipline to reply to email instead of letting it marinate for days and days.</p>
