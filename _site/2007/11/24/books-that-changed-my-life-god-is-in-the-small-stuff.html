<p>My parents got me <a href='http://www.amazon.com/God-Small-Stuff-Graduates-Bickel/dp/1593102283/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1195696045&sr=1-2'>God Is In the Small Stuff: Graduate's Edition</a> when I graduated from high school. You know, as one of those sentimental things to help to establish that an important part (or maybe not so important) of your life is now complete.</p>

<p>The whole purpose is to help slow you down and to teach you to appreciate God in the day to day and not just in the &#8220;big miracles&#8221; that are less common. I think <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Meyer'>Joyce Meyer</a>&#8217;s would have liked this book. Very much her style if that means anything to you.</p>

<p>With only two pages per chapter, it&#8217;s a simple read. The material though is so refreshing that it really requires some reflection. A review of the book on Amazon labels it as &#8220;Common sense that&#8217;s not so common sense&#8221;. I think that works.</p>
