<p>I have recently realized that I naturally tend to experience and create community with the people around me. I first started thinking about this when I was walking down the university hallways with a buddy of mine from class! I literally said &#8220;hi&#8221; to maybe 4-5 people that afternoon. He was amazed at the amount of people I knew.</p>

<p>We are all energized in different ways. For me, I gain energy from being around people and growing deep with them. So I naturally spend a significant amount of energy creating pockets of communities in different places. Looking back, I can now see why so many different groups, organizations and activities I had been involved with were highlights of my life. There&#8217;s something about being with a group of people in a very intense environment (e.g. a musical, missions trip, sports team) that brings people close together. These were some of my most cherished times as I grew to know those I was with in a deeper and meaningful way.</p>

<p>Amazing how we&#8217;re all wired. I hope this wasn&#8217;t as disjointed as it seemed when I wrote it.</p>
