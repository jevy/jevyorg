<p>I don&#8217;t read much, but when I do, they are usually very good. So I&#8217;ll try to post a couple of them.</p>

Them: "So what's it about?"
Us: "It's about this boy.. and a tiger.. out at sea in a lifeboat.. and well.. that's like.. it!"
Them: "Wow.. sounds lame"
Us: "Actually, it's amazing"

<p>I loves stories. Especially stories that express people&#8217;s deepest emotions. This book is about Pi (actually the character&#8217;s name!), his search for spirituality and then his time on the life boat. Yann Martel has an incredible ability to describe the scene without having it be overwhelming or monotonous. I remember reading this during second year university and it allowed me to recapture the imaginative side that perhaps I was loosing among all the Calculus and Mechanics/Dynamics courses I was taking at the time. This realization came to me on the way home from a long day of classes. I can still vividly remember the whole scene. I was so lighthearted and satisfied for the rest of the day. It&#8217;s like I had found something that was lost!</p>
