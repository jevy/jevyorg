<p>5 weeks into my new job and things are going quite well! The only problem is running out of energy around the 11am mark. After eating and getting re-focussed I can make it until the end of the day but being completely whipped out. I saw an &#8220;environmentalist&#8221; doctor who not only looks at the current symptoms but a holistic approach. Re-freshing to say the least.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m back to cutting out: sugar, wheat, yeast, corn, dairy and anything moldy. Holla! So what does this leave? Really quite a bit, but certainly I am limited on many preprocessed foods. Everything I eat is pretty much going to be organic and made from scratch. Tonight for example, instead of using canned diced tomatoes, my parents happened to go by the local market on Saturday and picked up fresh ones. 5 minutes with a food processor and TADA! Fresh diced tomatoes.</p>

<p>Is it excessive? I&#8217;m not entirely sure really. Many people I&#8217;ve spoken with really don&#8217;t trust pre-processed and canned foods so I figure it&#8217;s worth a shot.</p>
