<p>&#8220;Holy crap? Is it 8am?&#8221;</p>

<p>So, today I set my alarm to 8am in the hopes that I could try to get to work a bit later (and get more sleep). So anyways, the alarm goes off. I get through the shower and breakfast, catch the early bus and get to work.</p>

<p>I check my computer: 8am? What the heck? That&#8217;s earlier than I get here normally!!! I guess that I either: a) never had my alarm set properly in the first place or b) it never went off, I just looked at the clock and autopilot kicked in for the morning routine. So really, that bus wasn&#8217;t early at all, it was right on time. Come to think of it, it was seeing the 7:35am regulars at 8:35am too. &#8220;Wow! Maybe other people are trying to sleep in too! What smart people!&#8221; Wow</p>
