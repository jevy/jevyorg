<p>So I&#8217;ve decided to give up on my clock radio. There isn&#8217;t too much work left for it but I kinda lost interest since I usually get up five minutes before my alarm goes off anyways.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s my dream project: develop tiny modules, that are self aware of their location (gps or otherwise), that communicate with each other via a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking'>mesh network</a>. Ideally, they should each be flexible enough that they could have different sensors attached and broadcast that information using the same protocol.</p>

<p>So many interesting technologies to look into. So many papers to read! I don&#8217;t even know where to start really..</p>

<p>.. or maybe I just need more to do these evenings.</p>
