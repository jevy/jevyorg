<p>I love my city, I really do. I&#8217;ve always tried to get out of the suburbs into the city and find things that this city has to offer. Ever since high school I&#8217;ve always heard people say how boring Ottawa is compared to Toronto or Montreal. While it&#8217;s true they are bigger cities with more going on, Ottawa has tons of interesting stuff going on! As with anything, it just takes time and energy to find those things.</p>

<p>Here are some of my favorite links for living in the city of Ottawa. Maybe there&#8217;s more? If so let me know.</p>

<p>Restaurant reviews and discussions: &lt;ul&gt; <li><a href='http://restaurantthing.com/ca/on/ottawa/index.php'>Restaurantthing.com</a> - Used this for years.  There are fights in the reviews between competing ethic food restaurants.  It's quite entertaining.  Don't trust all the reviews but it's a good reference.</li> &lt;li&gt;<a href='http://ottawafoodies.com/'>Ottawafoodies.com</a> - Interesting local site. There&#8217;s a <a href='http://wiki.ottawafoodies.com/doku.php?id=events'>wiki</a> with events. I never would have heard of this stuff otherwise.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>Events: <ul>
<li><a href='http://www.ottawaevents.org/'>Ottawaevents.org</a> - Ghetto looking site with great updates.  They put lots of effort to find the right stuff.  I get their RSS feed so I get all the latest and greatest.</li>
<li><a href='http://attractionsontario.ca/'>Attractionsontario.ca</a> - If you're willing to travel the province a bit, this new site might have some ideas for you.
P.S.  I'm writing this on the train coming back from Montreal.  Cool!</li>
</ul></p>

<p>I might think of more later and will then make this a stand-alone page.</p>
