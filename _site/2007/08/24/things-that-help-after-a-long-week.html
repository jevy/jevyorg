<ul>
	<li>Being thankful.</li>
	<li>Driving with windows down.</li>
	<li>Spending time with people you care about.</li>
</ul>
<p>So really, I&#8217;m discovering much of life is all about perspective. If you see things one way, you will have that attitude. If you see it in a different light, your attitude will be completely different. Choosing every day to see the brighter side is important I think.</p>
