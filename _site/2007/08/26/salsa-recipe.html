<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate that I can&#8217;t eat some of my favorite foods but thankfully there are some that I can still eat. Salsa for example is one of those things. I&#8217;ve been making salsa since I was about 12 or 13 and make a bunch every couple of months. I decided this week that it was time to see if I could make my salsa even better! The heat is medium.</p>

<p>6+ jars and 4 hours later, here&#8217;s the recipe I put together. It&#8217;s fully organic and candida friendly. :D</p>

<p>To make 4 cups/salsa (one mason jar) <ol>
	<li>Combine in a medium pot:
<ul>
	<li>5 cups of diced tomatoes</li>
	<li>3 Green Onions diced</li>
	<li>2 Green Peppers chopped</li>
	<li>4 Garlic cloves minced</li>
	<li>2-4 Jalapenios to taste</li>
	<li>1 tea spoon of salt</li>
	<li>2 table spoons of lime juice</li>
	<li>2 table spoons of lemon juice</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon of cumin spice</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Mix well, bring to a boil and let simmer for an hour or so.  The tomatoes will boil down and some of the liquid will evaporate.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Enjoy! <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/jevy/1244520620/' title='Photo Sharing'><img src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1268/1244520620_f3bc6ce31d.jpg' height='333' alt='070826148' width='500' /></a> <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/jevy/1243741579/' title='Photo Sharing'><img src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1415/1243741579_59fceb0f59.jpg' height='333' alt='070826150' width='500' /></a> <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/jevy/1243737661/' title='Photo Sharing'><img src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1152/1243737661_7768448d04.jpg' height='500' alt='070826149' width='333' /></a> <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/jevy/1243657951/' title='Photo Sharing'><img src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1022/1243657951_2abe43fec5.jpg' height='333' alt='070826147' width='500' /></a> <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/jevy/1244604030/' title='Photo Sharing'><img src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1380/1244604030_6ba01b1853.jpg' height='500' alt='070826151' width='333' /></a></p>
