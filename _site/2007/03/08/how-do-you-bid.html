<p>I just came across this really cool website put on by everyone&#8217;s favorite online auction - Ebay! It basically goes through all the personality types who shop on the site to have you relate to someone on there. It&#8217;s really a great marketing technique to sort of develop a community in the sense that somehow, Ebay acknowledges that you&#8217;re in it for the adrenaline rush, the good deals whatever! Somehow, I feel more validated as an Ebay-er now. Which personality am I? HA! Wouldn&#8217;t that take all the fun out it if you knew my strategy?</p>

<p>Sidenote, I&#8217;ve probably bought and sold about 40 things on Ebay over the years. It seems like quite a bit really.</p>
