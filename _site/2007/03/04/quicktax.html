<p>As I am typing this with one hand, the other is holding the phone listening to silence. It has been literally 5 minutes since I&#8217;ve heard anything from the other side and the thing is&#8211; I know someone&#8217;s there.</p>

<p>I decided to call up quicktax to ask a question regarding their software. Here&#8217;s how it went: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Automated machine: &quot;Thanks for calling.  The wait is approx. 15 minutes&quot;.  No music.. nothing.</pre></p>
