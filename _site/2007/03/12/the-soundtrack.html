<p>So I&#8217;ve always had a hard time enjoying classical music and yet I have always loved scores to soundtracks of movies and shows. I have recently discovered <a href='http://www.streamingsoundtracks.com/'>StreamingSoundtracks.com</a>. Maybe soundtracks are really emotional and yet I hear that classical music <em>is</em> really emotional. In any case, it&#8217;s great. Enjoy!</p>
