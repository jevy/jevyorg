<p>So, I don&#8217;t like to really talk about stuff I buy, but I needed to mention this.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I have &#8220;the shakes&#8221; or what, but so many of my pictures turn out blurry from me moving the camera too much. Even with my 50mm f/1.8 lens, things come out blurry. WHAT THE HECK?</p>

<p>So, today I got a stinking good deal on the Nikon 18-200mm VR lens.</p>
