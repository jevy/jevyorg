<p>Wow.. I simply cannot get this song out my head: <blockquote> This is the correlation of salvation and love
(Don't drop your arms)
Don't drop your arms, I'll guard your heart
With quiet words I'll lead you in
-- Anberlin - The Unwinding Cable Car</blockquote> <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLxgrCQSaB8'>Youtube it</a>.</p>
