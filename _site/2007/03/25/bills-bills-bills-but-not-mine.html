<p>Over the next couple of days, I&#8217;ll be going up to Parliament hill with an organization called &#8221;<a href='http://4mycanada.ca'>4MyCanada</a>&#8221; meeting with MPs and sharing our heart for this country. Anyways, so I&#8217;m just spending some time researching what&#8217;s going on in the House of Commons. Man! Is it ever interesting. The <a href='http://www2.parl.gc.ca'>Parliament of Canada</a>&#8217;s website makes things very accessible. Take finding the recent bills in the House of Commons for example: You can see <a href='http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HouseBills/BillsGovernment.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1'>all the bills</a> before the house and the <a href='http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=status&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1'>recent news</a> about each!</p>

<p>Anyways.. an interesting way to spend part of a Sunday afternoon.</p>
