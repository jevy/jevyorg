<p>John was in many ways my engineering mentor. He setup my first Linux box when I was in ninth grade.. it got hacked.. He gave me advice which Eng stream to join, gave me advice to volunteer with a prof which ended up landing me a sweet job. He&#8217;s now in Waterloo working on his Ph.D and came up (partially) to ring me at &#8220;The Ritual Calling&#8221;</p>
