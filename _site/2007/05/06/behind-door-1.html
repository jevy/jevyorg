<p>A new (used) car!!!! That&#8217;s right folks. I found a sweet deal in the autotrader last Sunday. Called her up and flew down to Windsor (<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/jevy/tags/windsor/'>Pics here</a>) on Wednesday, gambled away (in slots) $10, picked it up and drove back on Thursday. I love &#8216;er.</p>
