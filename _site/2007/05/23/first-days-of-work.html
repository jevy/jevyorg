<p>So I started work yesterday morning. It&#8217;s nice to sit down and feel like you&#8217;re contributing to the world somehow (the money&#8217;s nice too). My manager showed me around, gave me an overview of the organization and the team and took me out for lunch.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to brag.. but working for the federal government rules. ;)</p>
