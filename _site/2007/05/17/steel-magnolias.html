<p>Steel MagnoliasSo with the Roger&#8217;s Digital box thinger, they have a rolling selection of free movies. WHATTTTT!!! So I&#8217;ve spent some time watching a couple of them.</p>

<p>Tonight I watched <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098384/'>Steel Magnolias</a> (okay, so the selection isn&#8217;t that great). I have to say I actually quite enjoyed it! The writing was great in that they were able to really convey the serious parts and yet lighten the mood at just the right time. I&#8217;m trying to think of a more eloquent way to say that but that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got.</p>

<p>By the end as they were driving off to the hospital, I cried just a bit and just really want to appreciate life more. I have this tendency to not really enjoy myself unless I &#8220;seize every moment&#8221;. I&#8217;m starting to learn that life is in the day to day and really appreciating even the small joys, and sad times. Maybe that&#8217;s why I liked this movie. It wasn&#8217;t really about anything spectacular event, but the day to day happening in these women&#8217;s lives and them enjoying it.</p>

<p>.. I&#8217;m glad I had this little discussion with myself. I hope by you reading this post it will make it feel less like a self pep talk. Cheers!</p>
