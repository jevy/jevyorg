<p>On Friday a bunch of us went to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Upton'>Jason Upton</a>&#8217;s concert down at Dominion Chalmers. Man! Probably one of the most fun concerts I&#8217;ve ever been to.</p>

<p>It started off with some of his own worship stuff which was really really great stuff. You could really sense God inspiring him as he played. He took a couple of minutes to address the crowd. He started talking about creativity and arts. <blockquote>
Jason: Any artists in the house?
*A bunch of people yelled out YEAAHHH*
Jason: Cool!
* A harmonica plays from the back of the venue *
Jason: Whoa!  What was that?  Come up here.
* Nothing happens so he keeps talking.  A raggity 'ol fellow who looks drunk comes up to the stage *
</blockquote></p>

<p>At this point I&#8217;m sure most of us were thinking &#8220;oh man.. a drunk guy invited on stage? This isn&#8217;t going to end well.&#8221; Jason invites him on stage to play with him. The guy plays a tune on the harmonica&#8211; &#8220;you know that one?&#8221;. &#8220;Uhhh&#8221; says the band &#8220;just play it! We&#8217;ll join you&#8221;. Anyways, so the guy starts playing and the band joins him! It was freaking sweet! How many bands (let alone worship leaders) would take a chance and invite a drunk guy on stage? Talk about breaking open people&#8217;s &#8220;boxes&#8221;.</p>

<p>Jason later shared his story of being born in 1973 of a 16 year old who had recently became a Christian. She refused to have an abortion despite hard pressure. She was in a place where she had to give him up for adoption. Anyways turns out the family he was placed with was a Christian family and raised him really well! Last year Jason met his mother for the first time. The crazy thing? She&#8217;s been listening to his CDs for the past six years. DWWHHATTTT?? So cool!</p>
