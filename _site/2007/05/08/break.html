<p>I haven&#8217;t had a holiday (break?) for nearly two years. I think my body was just running out of gas resulting in some real fatigue issues. So for the past week (and the next two), I&#8217;ve been taking it easy doing the following: <ul>
	<li>Learning morse code (again)</li>
	<li>Playing video games (namely, Battlefield 2142)</li>
	<li>Driving around my new car</li>
	<li>Reading</li>
	<li>Enjoying the sun</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Amazingly enough, the days go by quickly. I can&#8217;t imagine how I&#8217;d feel had I jumped into work right after school. Whoa.</p>
