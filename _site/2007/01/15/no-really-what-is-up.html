<p>So, things all and all are going quite well! <ul>
	<li>The classes for school look about 100x more interesting than last semester's classes so the motivation to go should be significantly more.</li>
	<li>The final project is going well and my team mate and I are feeling pretty confident about things.  Maybe I'll post a video showing where we're at.</li>
	<li>I've found a killer "Young Adults" group at the other side of the city.  There are about 7-8 of us but we have a great time when we get together.  The problem?  It's a 35 minute drive.  Boo.</li>
	<li>We had a prayer meeting for our Mardi Gras outreach coming up in Feb.  I'm actually mega pumped for the trip.  I'm meeting more of the 37 people going down and they're all cool people!  Whoa!</li>
</ul> Cheers!</p>
