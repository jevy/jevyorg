<p>Well, I did it. I&#8217;ve been at my beloved church Newlife, for over five years now. I feel that God is telling me it&#8217;s time to head out, out into the land of the unknown. Partly, I need to find a place with some people my own age who I can relate to. There are other reasons but that is one of the main ones. So I called up someone on the leadership team and put my heart out on the table (over the phone?). He said it&#8217;d be sad not to see me there which is mutual for both of us for sure! So, I feel an obligation to announce it to the congregration as they have loved me and taken me under their wing for so many years.</p>

<p>Where to now? Lord knows&#8230; really!</p>
