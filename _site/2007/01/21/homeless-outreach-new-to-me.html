<p>Thursday night: Met with the team (mix of teens, adults and retired people) to just get a feel where people were at. Had some incredible worship (<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/jevy/364976320/'>pic</a>).</p>
<strong>Friday night</strong><blockquote>Jeff:  "Are you coming back next Friday?"

Jevin: "I dunno man, I'm an Orleans guy"

Jeff: "Oh okay, well, even for five minutes, if you want to hang, I'll be here".

Jevin: "You know, if I'm around.. I will!"</blockquote><strong>Saturday morning</strong><blockquote>Me: "Hey brother!"

Lee: "Hey!!  Are you giving stuff out?"

Me:  "Yeah!  I think this bag has your name on it!"

Lee:  "Nice!  Does it have gloves?"

Me:  "Let's see... yes!  Here ya go!  How about socks?  Whoa!  Furry insoles too!"

Lee:  "That's f***ing sweet!!  Thanks man!  Wow!"</blockquote>

<strong>Saturday afternoon</strong>
<p>I didn&#8217;t get to see any physical miracles or whatever, but I saw Christ&#8217;s heart. His heart from everyone. Me, you everyone. Wow. Note: I lost about four days of pic-a-day pictures in an accidental camera format. BOO! <span class='tt-flickr' /></p>
