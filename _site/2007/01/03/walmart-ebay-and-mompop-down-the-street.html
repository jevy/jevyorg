<p>The vast majority of the stuff that I buy (other than groceries and gas) is done online. Some of my favorite retailers are places like <a href='http://www.ebay.ca'>ebay </a>and <a href='http://directcanada.com'>directcanada</a>. Just yesterday I bought a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripboard'>stripboard </a>set from the UK for 1/3 the price I would at the local electronics store and today I bought an external soundcard online for about 25% off the local store.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s got me thinking about how this type of thing affects the local mom &amp; pop shops and my own moral responsibility on buying from them vs &#8220;the man&#8221; type stores. The internet has done tons to help build competition between businesses. Since you&#8217;re no longer limited to having to order from the store down the street or even the single catalog that you get in the mail quarterly, you can buy from any fly-by-night wholesaler that just opened last night. What does this mean for the electronics store down the road? Well, certainly they&#8217;ll have less business and will in turn make less money. So what should I do about it? That&#8217;s a fantastic and huge question.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really glad I took that &#8220;Philosophy of social, moral and religious&#8221; class back in third year. It really helped my learn how to round out my perspectives and try to balance them out based on my own beliefs etc. I don&#8217;t have answers, but it&#8217;s worth thinking about.</p>

<p>On a more serious note, time to watch &#8220;Snakes on a Plane&#8221;.</p>
