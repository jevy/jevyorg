<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. It&#8217;s a fun city to visit but I&#8217;m quite certain I could never live there. I went down to visit a bunch of friends I had made over the years. On one of the nights I went to an &#8220;alumni dinner&#8221; thing where C4C is trying to connect grads an help equip and encourage them in the work place. Step in the right direction for sure!</p>

<p>I was taking the subway back from my friend&#8217;s place listening to some United Live. As I was walking out of the Queen stop and girl turns to me and starts talking: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Her: *something*</pre></p>

<p>Me: <em>Pulls off headphones</em> Pardon me?</p>

<p>Her: I said, you have a beautiful voice.&lt;/blockquote&gt; .. I was floored. I don&#8217;t think anyone&#8217;s said that before. Maybe because I don&#8217;t sing in public much anymore&#8230; or maybe she was flirting with me. In any case, I was surprised and I&#8217;m sure I went beat red.</p>
<strong>Update</strong>
<p>The theme was global village for the New Years party. My costume: <div style='text-align: center'><img src='http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/n90404589_31159696_598-copy.jpg' id='image445' alt='Francais' /></div></p>
