<p>K&#8230; I have to be honest and say that I don&#8217;t think that electronic organizers will ever work for me. I&#8217;ve been using paper agendas ever since I traded my Palm Pro to my buddy James for a bag of BBQ Doritos in grade.. err.. 11?</p>

<p>Anyways, so I really want to get a moleskine for myself. I think it would be significantly better than the propaganda driven agendas they give us at school. Specifically, this baby <a href='http://www.moleskines.com/klmc517w.html'>here</a>. The problem? Comes to $40 on ebay. Ugh..</p>
