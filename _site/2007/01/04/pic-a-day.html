<p>So I&#8217;m still trying to figure out how to make this the easiest on myself, but I&#8217;m planning on taking a picture EVERYDAY for 2007. I already have <em>four</em> under my belt, only 361 to go. I&#8217;m hoping this will help me record my life for the year. I&#8217;m going to try to figure out how to automate the posts to flickr/jevy.org/livejournal. That would make life sweet.</p>

<p>The pictures may not come up every day, but I will certainly try. <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/jevy/sets/72157594460179337/'>The Flickr album</a>.</p>
