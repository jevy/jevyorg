<p>People say this movie &#8220;isn&#8217;t a typical Bond movie&#8221;. True enough! This is the first movie of the series and we see a different side of James that we never seen again: emotional involvement. This is really what I love about it, he actually demonstrates a &#8220;real love&#8221; that he has for the &#8220;Bond girl&#8221;. In the end however, he clams right up and we never see that again&#8211; in any other movie. Awesome!</p>
