<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve been to the gym. Since I have some free time in the next month, I thought I&#8217;d get started into it again. Ironically, after having a free gym available at school, and only finishing school, I&#8217;m going starting to work out at a gym I&#8217;m paying for. So I got myself a nice 45 year old personal training showing me the ropes (err machines) and set me up with a schedule. Three times a week baby. Yipes!</p>

<p>I should be fun though, I feel so good after I&#8217;ve spent an hour doing it.</p>
