<p>So for Alex, Brendan, and Matt&#8217;s birthday party I rented a Wii for the weekend. The flip side was I wanted to play it myself to see if I wanted to get one.</p>
<strong>Party #1: Birthday</strong>
<p>We played Tennis, Boxing, Wario Smooth Moves (glorious!), Wii Cooking Mama, Monkey Ball and Rayman Raging Rabbits. I have to say watching people get into the games is an absolute hoot! I can why people have these Wii-motes slipping and smashing TVs&#8211; my hands were crazy sweaty!! Personaly, I had a blast playing tennis and Wario Smooth Moves. Wario was probably <em>the</em> most random game I have ever played and I was laughing the whole way through! The downside is you have to finish the game before you can do multiplayer. Boo!</p>

<strong> Party #2:</strong>
<p>Four of us played Wario and pretty much all the Wii sports. I was as bad at golf as I am in real life therefore it&#8217;s realistic? Umm.. maybe. Anyways, we had a blast playing Wario. I think they enjoyed the randomness as much as I did. Man the elephant moves were always the hardest. <span>youtube aZ8HYHP27QE</span></p>
