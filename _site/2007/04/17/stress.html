<p>So I&#8217;m still not totally better at all. I&#8217;m still pretty tired and can sleep 9 hours a night. In the past month, four independent sources (a doctor, pharmasist, nurse and a lady who used to be really sick) all said that stress is a leading cause of people getting ill. Now, I don&#8217;t see myself as a really stressed out guy. In reality though, I haven&#8217;t had a break in two years. By break I mean doing <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>Recently, all I&#8217;ve wanted to do is play video games. I was almost feeling guilty about this but then I realized that I think it&#8217;s just my body saying &#8220;I want to relax!!!&#8221;. So that&#8217;s precisely what I&#8217;m going to do. Come April 27th, I&#8217;m going to spend three weeks doing nothing in particular. If it&#8217;s video games, awesome. Learning morse code? Sure!
