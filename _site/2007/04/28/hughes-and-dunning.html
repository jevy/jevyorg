<p>Communicate you turkeys&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. and you guys have a degree or two. Geez man, I think I deserve a PhD in Pain Relief.</p>

<p>Regards, Wm.</p>

<p>PS The real judge will be holding Kangaroo Court and you won&#8217;t be getting off this time, Nora. Winner gets my old jacket. PPS Jev, is there a God? Can&#8217;t be when they stick me with guys like this. Hell on earth, I suppose. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
