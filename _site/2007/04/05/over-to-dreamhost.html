<p>So, I&#8217;m trying to get away from the server in my basement. I simply don&#8217;t have the interest or energy to keep up with the latest updates for various packages I have on my Linux box. Really, all it does is host the website and connect to the printer. Both can be done fairly easily without a dedicated computer. So anyways, jevy.org is now going to be hosted at Dreamhost (for now)!</p>

<p>That computer is pretty loud in the basement anyways. Good riddance.</p>
