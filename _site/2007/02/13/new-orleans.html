<p>So I&#8217;m from Ottawa&#8217;s suburb of Orleans and I&#8217;m off to New Orleans tomorrow! It&#8217;s almost like they&#8217;re ripping off my &#8216;hood! .. but they&#8217;re not.. at all.</p>

<p>In any case, Mardi Gras is going to be happening and I&#8217;m sure that will be something else! We&#8217;ll be doing more outreach however and helping those who have been devistated by the hurricane. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have plenty of (clean!) pictures for y&#8217;all. Play safe!</p>
