<p>What&#8217;s up with <a href='http://jevy.org/2006/01/15/what-a-weekend/'>Januaries</a> bringing crazy weekends. Anyways, it was really a mind blowing weekend. I attended &#8221;<a href='http://www.4mycanada.ca/Siege07Conf/SiegeFebVision.html'>The Siege</a>&#8221; conference here in the city with about 700 other people. It was basically people praying for God to really impact this nation for it to be a place that is worthy of Him. I know that sounds strange but we can all admit there&#8217;s lots of stuff in this country that isn&#8217;t right. I&#8217;m not talking about the &#8220;typical&#8221; issues that people label Christians as having. But other stuff like how we treat the first nations, Quebec, integrity in business in government, issues with the working poor and homeless. This is important stuff for me too! So why not ask God to help us change things!</p>

<p>Note: If that site above sounds whacked out, just comment and I&#8217;ll explain in non-Christianeese.</p>
