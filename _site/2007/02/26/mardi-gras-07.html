<p>Well folks, that was probably one of the most intense seven days I&#8217;ve even spent in my life. Left from Ottawa on Wednesday and arrived in New Orleans 37 hours later. Whoa!</p>

<p>I expected the bus ride to be extremely draining and boring but it turned out to be anything but. I didn&#8217;t know most of the people but spending an enomous amount of time on a bus ride really seems to bring people together as a group. The sad thing is, now that the outreach is over, when will I really see these guys again? Anyways..</p>

<p>When coming into the city, those who had been the year before were amazed at how much reconstruction had been done since the year before. The highway coming into the city is above everything so it was easy to see what had changed. A year ago, many houses were covered in blue tarps as the hurricane had blown off the roofs. Apparently, things were much improved with the odd house without a roof (!). When we arrived, we ended up sleeping in a church just on the outskirts of New Orleans called &#8220;God&#8217;s house&#8221;. The guys in the youth room and the ladies in the sanctuary. In total, there was about 250 of us from across North America. It still really amazes me how little Americans know about Canada. I mean never even hearing about the city of Ottawa? Wow.</p>

<p>In any case, Mardi Gras is an interesting experience for sure. I spent an evening hanging around on <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Street'>Bourbon street</a> and two others out on Jackson square. The feeling I get is that people from outside of the city normal lives (software developers, auto part manufacturers) and come for a couple of days to let lose and do crazy things they would never do at home. When talking to people about this, some will call it an escape, others a vacation but I guess it all depends on the reason you were there in the first place.</p>

<p>Frankly, I believe God speeks today. One event at the outreach was having a &#8220;free spiritual readings&#8221; table where people could come and we&#8217;d ask God to use us to give them some encourgament by speaking into the circumstances of their lives. At one point, this middle aged guy walks up wanting a free reading. He had long dark hair, a black leader trench coat and stacks of rings. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to scare you&#8221; he said. I was working the table with another Canadian Melanie. We asked God &#8220;okay, what would you like to speek into John&#8217;s life&#8221;. It was amazing how Melanie and I both had the same sense about John&#8217;s character. We shared how God had given him an incredible ability to pick up on things spiritually going around him. A picture came into my head of him actually sailing on the ocean with a huge sail. I felt that God was wanting to let John know that He had great adventures ready but God needed John to let God take control and empower those. By the time we had given all that we had for him he took both of our hands and closed his eyes for about 10 seconds, said &#8220;thank you&#8221;, and held our hands for another 10 seconds before leaving. This dude was really affected by it. Awesome!</p>

<p>Okay, I feel the need to talk about the Cracker Barrel as ate there three times. They are all built exactly the same so it&#8217;s easy to notice the demographic of the people working and eating there. I&#8217;m sure half our gang ordered &#8220;Chicken Fried Chicken&#8221; everytime they ate there (including breakfast!?!). Stay away from the &#8220;chicken and dumplings&#8221; as deep fried gravy isn&#8217;t my idea of a &#8220;dumpling&#8221;. Some of this stuff is probably more deep fried than Chinese food. Deep fried Okra? Are you kidding me? I tried it&#8230; and it was nasty&#8230; like I expected something else?</p>

<p>It was an awesome time and I&#8217;d do it again in a second. Holla!</p>
