<p>On Friday downtown is packed with cars so I needed to park. In the evening I came back to the car and struck up a conversation with Aris. He&#8217;s a mexican guy who&#8217;s part owner of the lot. After about half an hour of me standing in this window he invited me in his shack to talk.</p>

<p>We talked about everything from his love for photography, politics, a lonely parking attendant that works for him, his daughters I think he was trying to hook me up with, religion, God and funny stories about his customers. You guys should park there and meet him if you guys need to park in south downtown. <blockquote>Him: "I have two daughters here in the city.  You married?"
Me: "No"
Him: "Girlfriend?"
Me: "Umm"
Him: "It's cool.. it's cool."</blockquote></p>
