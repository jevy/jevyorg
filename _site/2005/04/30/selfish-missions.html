<p>Up until just a couple of days ago, I was super frustrated with not doing a mission trip this summer. Despite the fact that I know that getting some engineering experience is good for and that I have done mission trips for the past 4 years, I&#8217;m still anxious. I&#8217;m realizing that perhaps my motives for going aren&#8217;t completely to serve Him which is what we should be doing out of love and not ritualistic reasons or fear. I think I want to go to be able to tell stories! Meet all kinds of people from across Canada! Hang out and explore places that are beyond my daily adventures.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m not say those motivations are particularly wrong, but if I shift my thinking to: &#8220;well, I&#8217;ve given this summer to God to do what He feels is best for me, then so be it! I&#8217;ll be cool with that&#8221; instead of reasons specified above, then I think that is a better perspective to have. So now I&#8217;m feeling a lot better about what&#8217;s coming up in the next four months. Not sure if that makes sense.</p>

<p>The textures came out really well, best at a large size: <div class='flickr-insert'><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/jevy/11637508/' title='The Traveller' rel='bookmark' target='_blank'><img src='http://jevy.org/wp-content/plugins/flickr-insert/11637508_9d7f018655_s.jpg' alt='The Traveller' /></a></div></p>
