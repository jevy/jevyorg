<p>The year&#8217;s nearly done. Looking back I don&#8217;t remember much. It really just whizzed by. I think the remember the most are simply the people. I hung out with some much more and some, well, never compared to other years. I think circumstances just tend to change these things.</p>

<p>Other stuff? I&#8217;ve grown spiritually which is really a solid investment. I&#8217;m finding myself reading the Word and simply meditating/praying/contemplating those words. So much comfort in them.</p>

<p>Whatever, one exam left and then what? I&#8217;m not a fan of being rejecting from everything from Starbucks to actual Eng jobs. Looks like I have to throw that out the door and try to find a local place downtown that I can make some cash (not to mention a change of pace from a lab with no windows in the summer). If anyone knows of a place downtown O-town that&#8217;s hiring, do let me know!</p>
