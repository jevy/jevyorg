<p>Everyone needs to blog! EVERYONE! Why? It&#8217;s simply the best way to keep up with people. This is my own personal opinion, but I love finding out what people think, random thoughts or what you&#8217;re feeling regarding life! I&#8217;m not so interested in your grandma coming over to dinner, but I am interested if she told you crazy stories about what she did in her small town or if she hunted on some exotic island (I think it&#8217;s Lost coming through).</p>

<p>More stuff that I love reading: <ul>
	<li>Thoughts of spirituality</li>
	<li>Geeky stuff</li>
	<li>Thoughts and interpretations of movies</li>
	<li>The latest music/song that you love that you want other people to experience</li>
	<li>Frustrations with society/media/life and looking for advice</li>
	<li>An open invitation for feedback on poetry, art, music etc.  Anything that helps me dream or get some creative brainwaves going on.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Those are all things that I love and I guess post often. That said, is their anything that you guys your suggest me posting more about? I mean, this is my blog but I want to give other people insight into what I&#8217;m thinking. Not in a selfish way, but I want to be transparent with you.</p>
