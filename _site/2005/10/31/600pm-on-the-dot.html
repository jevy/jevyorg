<p>Well, it&#8217;s 6pm in Suburbia&#8230; <em>ding dong</em> it starts with &#8220;the neighbors with the annoying barking dog&#8221;. Too bad Oct 31st isn&#8217;t as big as it was back in the day. Man, there was the craziest stuff going on. We&#8217;d strap on rollarblades to hit the houses mega fast and have french people yell at us: &#8220;Ils sont trop vieux la&#8221;. LOL!</p>
