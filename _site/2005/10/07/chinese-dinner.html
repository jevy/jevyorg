<p>I feel like everything&#8217;s falling out from under me. It&#8217;s more than likely a feeling that&#8217;s brought on by sitting at home on a Friday night holding a remote in one hand an a bag of pretzels in the other.</p>

<p>The solution? Some time in the Word and a quality froster. Total? $1.83. Life is much better ;)</p>

<p>Seriously though, I&#8217;m really grateful to everyone who comes to check out my blog. It&#8217;s nice to know that people want to keep up with me.. or at the <em>very least</em> get dirt on me :o</p>
