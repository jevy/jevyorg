<p>Wow.. it&#8217;s been a long week and the biggest day is still ahead. <a href='http://iagreewithpercy.com/whoispercy.php'>Percy</a> is speaking tomorrow and it&#8217;s going to be off the hook for sure. I was asked to be on a panel of four people at the evening event. I&#8217;m anxious (not really nervous) as my bible knowledge and apologetics (proof of God and Christ etc) isn&#8217;t really up to snuff. I&#8217;m praying that I&#8217;ll be useful on the panel and that the amount of projectiles hitting me in the eye will be kept to a minimum.</p>

<p>Seriously though, everyone should come out to one of the two times Percy&#8217;s speaking. He has an incredible story. Systems Eng 100%!!!!!!!!</p>
