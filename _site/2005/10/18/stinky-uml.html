<p>So I got home yesterday afternoon to work on my UML assignment that was due that same day. I started work when I got this really rotten B.O. smell coming from somewhere. I discretely check my armpits (don&#8217;t know why I was trying to be discrete, I was in my room by myself) to see if that&#8217;s where it was coming from. It didn&#8217;t seem like it, so I kept working. Five minutes later it&#8217;s back! WHAT THE HECK? So I sniff again. Turns out it&#8217;s THE TEXTBOOK! Man, so much worry over a stickin&#8217; textbook (literally).</p>
