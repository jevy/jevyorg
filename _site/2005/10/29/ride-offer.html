<p>Ott to TO/Guelph (Round Trip)</p>

<p>Leaving from Carleton Thursday, Nov 10th at 5:30pm. Drop off in TO/Mississauga is flexible but close to the 401 would be nice. Returning the afternoon of Sunday, Nov 13th.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty unsure of my own plans so we can work stuff out. I wanted to offer it to jevy.org and livejournal readers first before I post on the ott.rides newsgroup. I&#8217;ll let you know how much gas will be but of course that depends on how many come. I can take 4 plus 1 on the roof. If you take the roof, you get a discount on gas. I cruise at 115km/h since this matters to some people.</p>

<p>Requirements for the ride: <ul>
	<li>Bladder must be able to handle stopping for rest stops no more than 10 times.</li>
<li>Must stink less than a wet dog</li>
	<li>Easy going with music selection as I might just whip out some Justin Timberlake and Salt and Peppaaaaaaa.  Uhh.. but I won't so don't worry</li>
	<li>Be cool if we don't feel like talking the entire way.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Let me know</p>
