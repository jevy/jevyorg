<p>Went to Starbucks with a bunch of my friends to start up a bible study for the rest of the semester that will hopefully continue through next semester. I showed up and ordered my Grande Hot Chocolate: <blockquote>
Jevy: Hiya Kin!  Whatcha get?
Kin: Hot Chocolate.
Jevy: Seriously?  That's what I got.
*We go sit down as Dan walks in and orders*
Dan: Hey guys!
K and J: Word
Dan: What did you guys order?
K and J: Hot Chocolate
Dan: HAHA.  Me too.
* Travvy walks in... and orders nothing*
</blockquote> Anyways, we thought it was funny enough. Who orders hot chocolate?? Then we met up with the CRU gang and watched and watched &#8220;Les Choristes&#8221;. See above.</p>
