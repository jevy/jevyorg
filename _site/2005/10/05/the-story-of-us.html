<p>I&#8217;m heading to a <a href='http://www.peanutsandraisins.com'>wedding</a> on Saturday and I&#8217;m really pumped about it. I haven&#8217;t really been to many weddings before let along weddings of people I&#8217;ve been closer to. It&#8217;s of my two buddies from Carleton a few years back.</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#8217;m checking out the site and Shanny wrote a <a href='http://www.peanutsandraisins.com/about/book/'>book</a> for Jason. It&#8217;s the greatest thing ever!!</p>
