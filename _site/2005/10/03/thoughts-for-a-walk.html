<p>I skipped classes today <em>gasp</em> since I had plenty of work to do. I felt so dirty staying in my PJs until 8pm tonight. I changed and headed out on likely the nicest night we&#8217;ll have before winter hits. I think I&#8217;ve mentioned it before, but this neighbourhood is all grown up now. I&#8217;m sure the majority of the people I played with in the park back in the day have moved away to do other stuff. Which is fine, but it&#8217;s nice to remember them. I like the walks to simply clear my head of all sorts of things. I try not to think about things much when I&#8217;m walking since things never really get sorted out there anyways. So it&#8217;s mainly praying and wandering.</p>

<p>So we&#8217;re studying for Quantum Mechinics over <a href='http://www.skype.com'>Skype </a> tonight using <a href='http://www.groupboard.com/'>Groupboard</a> to do some visuals. We didn&#8217;t use it for anything useful other than <a href='http://bewblog.blogspot.com/'>Chan </a> and I making funny pictures. Credit to him for the Mortal Kombat knock off though.</p>

<p>Rich blessings y&#8217;all</p>
