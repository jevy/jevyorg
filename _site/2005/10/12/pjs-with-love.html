<p>Doing homework for 10 hours? No problem! The key? Do it in the your PJs. I stayed home for the day to finish an assignment worth 10% of my final mark. It&#8217;s music to my eyes (or something): <code>

<p>I&#8217;m really not sure what to do about all these earthquakes and just general devistation that&#8217;s happening all around the world. I&#8217;m debating on what my response should be to all of this. Honestly, hearing that 20K+ people have died is really just a number to me. I really would like to feel more compassion for them all but literally every month there is something new to give money, pray for, feel bad for. Is it the media&#8217;s fault? I don&#8217;t think so, they&#8217;re just telling us what&#8217;s happening. Is it my fault? I hope not, I mean, these are the natural emotions that are coming. ?!?!?!?!??!</p>
