<p>So it&#8217;s snowing 10cm today. I&#8217;m really torn about how I feel about it. Snow itself is pretty cool. My favorite is snow sitting on trees stacked up really high. I also just want to pat snow down with my hand just to feel the fluffiness. When I walk home from the 95 late on a Friday or Saturday night, I like to take my headphones off and just listen to the <em>crunch crunch</em> and <em>squeek squeek</em> until my feet. With a bit of wind and the street lights? Oh yeahhhhhhh</p>

<p>.. on the flip side, snow reminds me OF -40 PLUS WINDCHILL WAITING FOR THE BUS AT 7:20 IN THE MORNING HOLY CRAP HOLY CRAP HOLY CRAPPPPPPP! Eventhough it never seems to snow when it gets that cold. Weird..</p>

<p>.. but other than that&#8230; snow is good times..</p>
