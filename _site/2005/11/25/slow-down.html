<p>Instead of simply sitting and listening to another music CD on the bus, I&#8217;ve been searching for books/podcasts that will keep me &#8220;productive&#8221; on the bus. Music is great on the bus, don&#8217;t get me wrong but when you&#8217;re on the bus for two hours a day, I think I can spend it better.</p>

<p>So anyways, for half an hour a day, I&#8217;m going to try to listen to Dr. Dobson&#8217;s Focus on the Family. He&#8217;s a Psychologist from the States. It&#8217;s a quality program for sure! The reason I post this is that Wednesday&#8217;s program was great: &#8220;Slow down and Enjoy Life&#8221;. A pretty solid message even if Christianity isn&#8217;t your deal. <a href='http://boss.streamos.com/download/swn/saved/oneplace/ministries/ffd/mp3/free/ffd20051123.mp3?siteid=PodCast'>Here's the MP3</a>.</p>
