<p>Sites like this sadden me since it shows the real dirt that we all struggle with. At the same time, it makes me feel to good to know that some people are being honest about their problems since most of us just glaze over things so we don&#8217;t have to deal with it.</p>

<p>Anoymous postcards sent in with secrets. Some are really, really sad.
