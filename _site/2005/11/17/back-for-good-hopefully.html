<p>Well, I decided to format jevy.org as it got hacked. I have no idea what they did to the system so I figure it was better to start anew. It feels nice when everything&#8217;s fresh but I&#8217;ve got plenty to setup. After working with Linux for close to nice years, you think you&#8217;d have it all figured out.. well&#8230; no such luck. Anyways, if things are still acting wonky, let me know.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be working on my new site during exams if I can motivate myself between studying sessions. I think I might be too ambicious though :P</p>

<p>Things are really swell! Had a blast roadtripping down to Guelph last weekend to visit some old and new friends down there. It was an opportune time as midterms were pretty well done and I just needed a break. Really refreshing. That said, two weeks of class left. Then it&#8217;s that make-my-own-hours time of year as exams gear up. Shazzam!</p>
