<p>I thought today was going to be uneventful..</p>

<p>.. then I heard &#8220;The Sign&#8221; by Ace of Bass and then I started reflecting back to grade 5. Then a lady bug just landed on my keyboard. What&#8217;s it thinking!!</p>

<p>Sens vs. Tampa was awesome last night. It&#8217;s hilarious when people want a quiet <em>hockey</em> game. We started calling at St. Louis and this lady in front of us said &#8220;VOYON&#8230;.&#8221;. So I pretended to be from Iceland as if I didn&#8217;t understand that she was frustrated. Her son sorta looked at me and rolled his eyes at his mom. lol. Videos posted tomorrow!!</p>
