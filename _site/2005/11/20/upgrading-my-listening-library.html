<p>So every two weeks or so, I try to get some new stuff on my iPod to listen to on those long days in the lab or on the bus. I just found &#8220;The Official Lost Podcast&#8221;. Are you kidding me? Humm.. to be honest, I&#8217;m actually tempted to subscribe to it just so I can maybe get some more clues about stuff. WAIT NO! I&#8217;m not that obsessed. This is stupid&#8230;</p>
