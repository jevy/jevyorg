<p>I&#8217;m in my ritual lab at school after finishing a lab early. Can I feed your stereotype of engineers?</p>

<ul>
<li>The guy diagonally to my left is reading <a href='http://slashdot.org'>slashdot</a> and looking at screen shots from video games.</li>

<li>Two guys are talking about his cell phone.</li>

<li>The guy to my right is reading a newspaper in Chinese.</li>

<li>Then there&#8217;s a bunch of us studying notes online.</li>
</ul>
