<p>Okay, second post in half an hour..</p>

<p>Man, I think I post about how much being at home on the weekend sucks everytime I&#8217;m stuck at home on a saturday. I&#8217;m really having a hard time these days knowing that God&#8217;s calling me to a time a resting. What does that mean? I&#8217;m still trying to figure that out. It feels like things have slowed down in a life to a large degree. For about two months I&#8217;ve been itching to get moving again.. you know a big project or something else to jsut sink my teeth into and really make progress in life. It&#8217;s looking as though, I&#8217;m supposed to just sit, and wait. I&#8217;m realizing that resting is probably the most difficult thing that I <em>could</em> be doing right now as it&#8217;s really counter my personality. Soooooooo yeah&#8230; I think I&#8217;m going to read Billy Graham&#8217;s autobiography a bit.. maybe pray a bit.. study a bit and watch TV. Maybe ALL AT ONCE!!!!!!! Actually.. writing that out doesn&#8217;t make it sound so bad! Nice..</p>
