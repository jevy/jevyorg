<p>It&#8217;s funny the reaction I get from people when I tell them I&#8217;m studying engineering:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;ohhhhhhh&#8221;</li>

<li>&#8220;wow, you must be really smart&#8221;</li>

<li>&#8220;one of my roomie&#8217;s an engineer, we never see him&#8221;</li>

<li>&#8220;you must drink a lot&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>While it&#8217;s true that perhaps we have a heavier workload than most, I don&#8217;t understand why people automatically assuming that engineers are smarter than those who aren&#8217;t. I mean, I&#8217;d die you gave me three readings of 20 pages each a week! Holy crap! Why are the maths and sciences considered &#8220;smarter&#8221; than others? How come those who have really good social skills aren&#8217;t considered &#8220;smart&#8221; or how about mothers who raise their kids really well, is this not smart? A musician? An electrician?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s true, these all require different kind of smarts. If that&#8217;s the case, do we as a society look down on some career choices than others? For example, what parent actually aspires their son/daughter to become a plumber? Probably very few. It doesn&#8217;t really make sense since they make really good money and it has some real job security. I think it&#8217;s great to see that there are finally advertising trades in places like movie theatres to atract those who maybe do have those smarts to that particular area of work. <a href='http://www.careersintrades.ca/'>Careersintrades.ca</a> for example.</p>

<p>All that said.. back to studying Quantum Mechanics for Tuesday lol.</p>
