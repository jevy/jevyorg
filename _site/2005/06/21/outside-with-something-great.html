<p>Went out to Clocktower for beer and wings tonight. (They upped the prices for wings and beer sinec the last time I was there :P). Anyways, hearing stories about people and their experiences in East Asia (can&#8217;t say the name but it&#8217;s a large closed country) and Tanzania. It&#8217;s cool that people are really excited to hear about Jesus Christ over there.</p>

<p>It makes me wonder my own calling. People are talking about spending a year in some of these places. I&#8217;m really excited for them but I have some real spiritual conflicts with Campus Crusade that just don&#8217;t work with my personality and my understanding of how God has shown how He&#8217;s worked in my life. Now that will sound strange to those who don&#8217;t really know much about Christian culture or Christian organizations but basically what I&#8217;m saying is that I don&#8217;t feel that I could operate in this organization long term. I would choke.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited to find out in the next couple of years what God has in store for me longer term. G&#8217;night y&#8217;all.</p>
