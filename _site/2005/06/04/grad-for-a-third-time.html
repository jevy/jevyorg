<p>Well went with Eleesha to her St. Peter&#8217;s graduation last night. Went to the garden party way too early (started at 3, got there at 3:15) when there wasn&#8217;t really anyone there. People are so cutting and superficial, just overhearing some people talking about others it cut me deep even not knowing who they&#8217;re talking about.</p>

<p>The dinner/dance was at the Westin. Quite a nice hotel really. The food was really good and the people at our table were hilarious. I sort of forgot that these people are 3-4 years younger than me. Anyways, we hit the dance for and it was a killer! My date wanted to dance with her girlfriends which was totally fine so I went to dance with the people from our table. Everyone left really early to go pre-drink for the aftergrad I assume (seems so odd to me now). I was totally in the dancing mood to hit up the aftergrad but we didn&#8217;t go. That&#8217;s cool too. Anyways, solid time.</p>
