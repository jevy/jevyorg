	<li>I will for sure have to check out the <a href='http://ottawafringe.com/'>Ottawa Fringe festival</a>.  I haven't been in soooo long.  Anyone interested?</li>
	<li>I'm trying to get people to smile back at me when walking down the street.  Why does everyone look away?  What are the pretending to look at?</li>
	<li>Batman.  Solid.</li>
	<li>I like it when things in life get sorted out.</li>
