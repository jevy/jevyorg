<p>Showed up in Montreal with a friend of mine Jeff. I have a bunch of friends on a Campus Crusade missions project here so I came up to visit. Problem is, they all work during the day so they weren&#8217;t super excited about going out in the evening. I guess that&#8217;s my bad for coming down mid-week. My ride was going back this morning but I&#8217;m not super keen on going back to Ottawa just yet, I just want to sick around. I hope I&#8217;ll find some quality stuff to check out.</p>

<p>As much as I would like to meet people today, I would be content simply walking around. I&#8217;ll be back in Ottawa tonight or maybe tomorrow. No idea.</p>
