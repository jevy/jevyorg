<p>Holy Toledo! I think my prof feels that I&#8217;ve been working hard enough in the lab that he recommended me to the Dean to do some work for him. I met with the two women who do engineering recruitment for Carleton and they want me to work on two robots that they have to take around to high schools.</p>

<p>Soooooo I get paid to make these things do cool stuff??!?! WHATTTTT. It&#8217;s 17.5 hours a week which is awesome so I&#8217;ll have enough time to work for Radialink (if that ever comes through). Praise God! I&#8217;m so glad I gave this summer to Him.</p>
