<p>So for tonight I think we all might as well head on down to Heart and Crown. Kristy says Jay Colson&#8217;s band will be there so that would likely be a lot of fun. I&#8217;m thinking 9pm would be a good time to meet since we could probably still be able to snatch a table. If people get bored, feel free to drop by my place since I&#8217;ll be here until we head over there. Just give me a shot to let me know you&#8217;re coming over. 236-7341. I live at 234C Russell Ave.</p>

<p>See y&#8217;all there</p>
