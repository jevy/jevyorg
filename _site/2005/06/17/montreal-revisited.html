<p>I had an absolute blast adn am really stoked that I stayed the extra days. The project going on is similiar to &#8220;Toronto Project&#8221; that I was at two summers ago for those who remember that. Anyways, it&#8217;s the transition the main responsibility from the paid staff to the students on project so I was visiting in the middle of that. Needless to say it was pretty busy so I as sorta on the outside looking in. By Thurday though I had met a whack of people and they really included me and was able to pray with a bunch of them. Makes me miss project (for the relational aspect) but I know God&#8217;s got something great in store for me this summer so I&#8217;m excited for that too.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll post of pictures of Montral once I pull them off my camera.</p>
