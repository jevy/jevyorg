<p>Something else that I forgot to mention <a href='http://jevy.org/2005/07/20/homeless-spirituality/'>the other day</a>: We were of course talking about the weather with the homeless kids when one said something fairly profound: &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty sad when all that people have to think about it and talk about is how bad the weather is.&#8221; True sayyyy</p>
