<p>So I&#8217;m just trying out adding <tag>tags</tag> to my blog so that <tag>technorati</tag> will be able to pick it up. The site&#8217;s pretty cool but will get better once more people start using it. It shows what people are blogging about <em>right now</em> based on the tags that they are specifying right now. We shall see!</p>
<tags>blogging, news</tags>
