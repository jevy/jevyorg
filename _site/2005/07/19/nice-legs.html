<p>MAN! I love playing sports that don&#8217;t require me to be muscular! Ultimate today was amazing! Both teams were really respectful of one another and clapped for both sides when good plays/tries were made. Such an energy. If anyone wants to come and play/watch let me know. We&#8217;re always looking for more players (mostly GIRLS)! I&#8217;ll take pictures next Tuesday and post them.</p>
