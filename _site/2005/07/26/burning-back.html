<p>Such a killer weekend! Went on a two day &#8220;Intro to whitewater Kayaking&#8221; and I have to say I&#8217;m hooked. I seriously did not want to stop. The instructor was awesome and explained everything about why the water was doing such-and-such and what to look for etc. It was group of four of us two of which were my dad and I. I was initially reluctant about going since it was just him and I going since the conversation would be slow. It really wasn&#8217;t, we talked about all kinds of good stuff.</p>

<p>Anyways, I still have tons of pictures to post (although I didn&#8217;t get any of me getting my eskimo roll down the <em>first time</em>. Man I&#8217;m proud of that) and I&#8217;ll try to do that either tonight or tomorrow.</p>
