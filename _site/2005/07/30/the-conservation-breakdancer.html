<p>Don&#8217;t ask me how I came across this site but it&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s this chubby breakdancer that goes around to various demonstrations and talks to the people about their issues from a conservative standpoint. It&#8217;s pretty funny and usually ends up pop &#8216;n locking for them. For sure worth checking out: <a href='http://www.popandlock.com'>popandlock.com</a> with Rippin&#8217; Richie.</p>
