<p>So my brother calls me from Orleans on Wednesday: &#8220;Internet&#8217;s down&#8221;. I figure it&#8217;s a power outage problem and it will be back sometime soon. Sunday rolls around and it&#8217;s still not back yet so I call up <a href='http://www.istop.com'>istop</a>. <blockquote>
Jevin: Hi!  Could I speak with tech support please?
Lady: Umm.. what about?
Jevin: Ummmm well... internet's been down since Wednesday and it looks fine on my end
Lady: Yeahhhhh.... Bell cut us off so we got bought out by Cybersurf.  So you'll need to change your user name and password.  Except to be back online in the next 1-5 business days.
Jevin: Really?  Wow... okay.. let me know the info.
</blockquote></p>

<p>I glad they let me know these things. Turns out I get a call from the Cybersurf guy on Monday explaining the situation and what to do. Weird! Check out their <a href='http://istop.com/news.html'>news</a> section. They sound bitter and understandably so.</p>
