	<li>So my friend and I were in charge on "LifeKidz" church today.  Picture a 22 and a 19 year old trying to control, entertain and educate 12 three to ten year olds.  Eeep!  We taught them some "old-school" Christian songs that these poor kids didn't know.  How about Jesus Loves Me and This Little Light of Mine WITH ACTIONS!!  We both rocked out with the guitars and were acting overly excited in a desperate attempt to get these kids pumped.

As you might notice, jevy.org looks a bit different.  I changed the theme to something else for now.  I probably will use this one and change the colours, headers etc.  Looks pretty classy I think.

ARGH!  I can't believe I forgot the sandwhich meats in the fridge back home.  UGH!

Just remembered (read found out) that my parents are gone for a week starting Wednesday night.  So I'm heading home to cook and water back in Orleans.  I was supposed to head to TO this weekend so I'm pretty dissapointed that I can't.  End of July I suppose I can make it.

Friday went to "World Beats and Eats" held at Mercury Lounge.  It was good times!  $8
for a whack of food, culinary lesson and fun music.  I can justify reading Dose solely on the event listings everyday.
