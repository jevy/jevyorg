<p>Hey gang! Well, I always thought it would be a cool idea about reading the bible from start to finish so I found the &#8220;One Year Bible&#8221; in my basement that my mom bought when she became a Christian like twenty some years ago. Anyways, I just started the daily reading and I think it would be cool to get a community going of a bunch of people doing the same. You know, encourage each other and keep each other accountable. You obviously don&#8217;t have to a Christian to do this, in fact I think it would be great to have different perspectives during the year. The commitment is probably 15 minutes a day of reading.</p>

<p>So, starting January 1st for all interested, we&#8217;ll have a a blog online that we can all contribute too. Ask for it for Christmas!

Email me or leave a comment if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
