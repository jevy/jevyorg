<p>Not much going on. No news is good news? Time to throw the studying into high gear though.</p>

<p>Two good sites: <ul>
	<li><a href='http://www.microsoft.com/canada/smallbiz/vogoffers/timhortons/default.mspx'>Free $5 Tim Hortons gift certificate</a> (if you have a legal copy of Windows)</li>
	<li><a href='http://cuteoverload.com/'>Cute Overload</a> (I like the dog with the ducklings chasing it.  They're going to have real identity issues.)</li>
</ul></p>
