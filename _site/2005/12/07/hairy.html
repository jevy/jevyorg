<p>So a bunch of us are growing the &#8220;exam beard&#8221;. Now, I haven&#8217;t had facial hair since first year and I now remember why. It&#8217;s stinking gross! I don&#8217;t mind a little stubble after 3 days of not shaving. But man, a week and some? Ewwie</p>

<p>When I was doing Toronto project, three summers ago (holyyyyyy) I had a decent goat with a &#8216;stache. That in itself was okay. I asked the receptionist at work (who wasn&#8217;t much older then I was) what she&#8217;d do if I just had the mustache. She said she wouldn&#8217;t talk to me. I shaved off the goatee the next morning and sure enough, she wouldn&#8217;t even look at me. It was gone the next day.</p>

<p>Anberlin - Ready fuels has been stuck in my head for the past two days. Giddy up!</p>
