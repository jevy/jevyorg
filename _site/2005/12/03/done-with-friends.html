<p>Well, Thursday was a particularly sad day as it was the last class that I will ever be having with my engineering friends from first year. I&#8217;m going to be taking a fifth year, and as such, still have two third year classes to catch up on next semester. On top of that, I&#8217;m taking an engineering elective that none of my friends are opting to take (common&#8217;!!! DSP is going to be incredible!!). Not that I like looking too far ahead but next year could be rough not having my friends in any of my classes. Oh well&#8230;</p>

<p>.. maybe time to move out next year? :o</p>

<p>P.S. Funny pictures coming soon</p>
