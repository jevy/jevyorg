<p>Holy crap. I Skyped up Chan to ask about some equations for Quantum I didn&#8217;t get:</p>
<blockquote>
Jevy: Hey man.  What's the S.E equation and solution for tunnelling?
Bew: I don't know man.  I'm studying networking.
Jevy: Whoa!  You feel that good about Quantum that you can study for tomorrow's exam when we have Quantum today?
Bew: WHAT???  We have Quantum tomorrow!
Jevy: WHAT?!!??!?! Quantum's today!  Stop lying
Bew: No man..
Jevy: WHAT?!?!  I'm sweating everywhere. AHHHHHH
Bew: AHHHH I'm shaking for you.  Let's go to school.  I'll teach you everything!
Jevy: AHHHHHHHH
.. and here we are. With two hours before an exam I'm barely studied for.  WHAAA
