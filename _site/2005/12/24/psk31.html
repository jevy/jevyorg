<p>So a (ham) friend came over the other day to lend me one of his radio that&#8217;s designed exclusively for this mode called <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSK31'>PSK31</a>. Anyways this radio plugs into your soundcard and does the analog to digital conversion through there then the computer modulates and demodulates. It&#8217;s called the SWL PSK-20 and puts out only 2 Watts! 2 WATTS?! That&#8217;s like 1/30 the amount that a light bulb puts out. Anyways, the thing above is the &#8220;waterfall&#8221; showing all the people that you can hear through your <a href='http://jevy.org/random/ant1.jpg'>antenna</a>. Click on whatever frequency you want to listen to and whazzam!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve mad 9 contacts (from Cuba and the US) over three days and could obviously get more if I was running a stronger signal. Anyways, geeky good times.</p>
