<p>I&#8217;m sitting here just as my entire basement computer room shakes. They&#8217;ve been blasting for the new Wal-mart a few kms from my house all through the fall and I guess they started back up again as the ground is not as frozen. So every morning around 10am. <em>BAM BAM BAM</em> all right after each other.</p>

<p>I got hardcore rejected yesterday. I was hoping to be a counsellor for the Shad program here at Carleton for the month of July. They wanted Entrepreneur experience, solid leadership and people skills (I hear you people laughing arleady) and technical background. All of which I feel I have. Anyways, I think about 20 people submitted their application for 6 positions. But I got this back today when asked if they have started interviewing: <blockquote>Yes we have. We received a number of outstanding candidates this year that were reviewed by myself and my program manager. Although you have a good application we decided not to interview you. Thanks for your interest in Shad though! </blockquote> DISSSS!! My parents are really nice about it and are convinced (and trying to convince me) that it must be an inside job. Whatever, God&#8217;s got something else His sleave I suppose ;)</p>
