<p>My head is full of things that are up in the air and it pisses me off. I like it when I can put things aside and look at it and say &#8220;okay.. I&#8217;m done with you now&#8221; or &#8220;well done&#8221; or &#8220;perfect, now you&#8217;re good to go&#8221; or &#8220;well, that sucked.. time to move on&#8221;..</p>

<p>.. not that these unfinished things are super life changing: jobs, apartment hunting, school, an I Agree With campaign in the fall I&#8217;m in charge of that I&#8217;ve been working on for a year (!). Those types of things.</p>
