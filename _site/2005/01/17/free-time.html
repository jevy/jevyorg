<p>Okay, this will really sound really lame and make it sound like &#8220;everyone wants to hang out with me&#8221; but it&#8217;s really not, it&#8217;s just a practical way to let those people who like me (please love me) and who I really dig hanging out with know my schedule.</p>

<p>Below are the free times I have this week. If anyone wants to hang out/grab a beer/play squash please drop me an email or private comment.</p>

<p>Tuesday - Doing homework all night Wednesday - free after 11:30am. Would love to play squash then grab a beer here. Thursday - class 11:30am-2:30pm. Squash afterwards? Friday - Probably free from 12:30-1:30</p>
