<p>It&#8217;s true! I confess, I&#8217;m a geek. I just spent two hours looking a blogs getting ideas for my new website. I&#8217;m not really keen on doing it right now but it seems like a great distraction from school (not that I have done any real homework yet).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure why I&#8217;m so keen on blogging. Do I feel I have something worthwhile to say? Is it a way to gain popularity or to convince people that I&#8217;m trying to be smart? Really though, I think it&#8217;s just me wanting to stay in touch with everyone else (wether or not I even know you) because I really enjoying sharing life with people. Hope everyone had a super weekend.</p>
