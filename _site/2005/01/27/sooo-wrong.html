<p>LOL! A guy in my bible study sent us all these &#8220;Christian pickup lines&#8221;. So very sketchy, but quite hilarious. Here&#8217;s what he said:</p>

<p>well boys, the big V day is coming up so I thought I would help some of you out. Here are some classic pick up lines for meeting christian ladies, I&#8217;ve used a few of these myself in the past. Now some of you may say that these are cheesy and dumb, but the ones who say that are probablly single, so suck it up princess, and put these lines to good use.</p>
