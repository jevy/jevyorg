<p>So <a href='http://www.wordpress.org'>wordpress</a> is installed. But I haven&#8217;t integrated it into my site yet. It might be a little while since I have it worked out so you know what that means: <strong>NEW WEBSITE TIME</strong>! Not that I have time for it&#8230; ugh</p>

<p>It&#8217;s nice that it can crosspost to my livejournal account so I can wean away from it and can still keep all my LJ friends in the loop. YEYE</p>
