<p>Baptism is a pretty simple thing really. It&#8217;s a public declaration of your faith symbolized by going under water (dying with Christ) and coming back up (being resurrected as Christ was). It was commanded for us to do this to one another as people come to faith. Check it out: <a href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%2028:18-20;&version=31;'>Matthew 28:18-20</a>. What a beautiful thing. Pictures <a href='http://jevy.org/gallery/Baptism/'>here</a>.</p>
