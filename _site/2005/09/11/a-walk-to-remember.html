<p>I went for a walk this evening just to clear my head and to get some fresh air. I walked along the edge of the park when I seldomly walk when the memories came rushing in.</p>

<p>.. they were beautiful ..</p>

<p>.. grades 1-6 don&#8217;t seem so long ago as I can remember them like they just happend. I feel like I should be doing more with them, like actively enjoying them or reminising with other people about them. Somehow it seems like I&#8217;m the only that cares about the memories and I wonder why. Maybe I just have a hard time letting go.</p>

<p>One house in particular had their garbage out two days in advance. They were through out all kinds of kids stuff like hockey helmets and doll houses. I&#8217;m not purposely trying to be sentimental but wouldn&#8217;t people want to keep this stuff to just enjoy looking at it? I don&#8217;t even know what to do with memories. I suppose just let them sit on the shelf and make sure that they&#8217;re not completely forgotten for that day when you&#8217;re old and dying.</p>
