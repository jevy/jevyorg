<p>I was reading about an Ontario ghosttown in <a href='http://ottawacitizen.com/'>the Citizen</a> today and thought I&#8217;d check out to see if there are any close that would be worth exploring. Came across <a href='http://www.ontarioghosttowns.com/'>ontarioghoststown.com</a> (go figure) and this other somewhat related site: <a href='http://www.infiltration.org/'>infiltration.org</a>. Check out teh <a href='http://www.infiltration.org/abandoned-bct.html'>Buffalo Central Terminal</a>. Interesting story.</p>
