<p>Okay here are those things you just have to know for riding the <a href='http://www.octranspo.com'>OC Transpo</a> buses in Ottawa:</p>

	&lt;li&gt;The buses are a game you just have to figure out the best way to play it.  Figure out if multiple buses go where you&apos;re going.  If buses are often packed when you try to get on, figure out where the majority of people get off and take a different (empty) bus to that location so you can jump on a bus with plenty of space.  IE. St-Laurent.
	&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t be a jerk and keep a seat if there&apos;s an old person/disabled/blind/physically-impaired-in-someway-that-they-will-go-flying.  I know you&apos;re pretending not to see them by reading or staring out the window.  Whatever!  Use those legs!  You&apos;ve been sitting in a class for 3 hours, are you _that_ tired?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pack those buses tight.  Why the heck don&apos;t you move to the back?  How about you try having to catch the next bus at -40 degrees PLUS WIND CHILL because some jerk wants his personal space.  I swear I&apos;m not bitter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Easy on the cologne/perfume.  The combination of more than 2 of them will drive anyone up the wall.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Oh my goodness.  There&apos;s nothing worse than trying to get off of a packed bus when you&apos;re not close to a door.  If people would step off and hold the doors, life would be much easier on me, and you!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Relax!  It won&apos;t kill you if you don&apos;t have the most efficient system down.  I&apos;m preaching to myself mostly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</pre>
