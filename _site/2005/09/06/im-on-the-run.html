	&lt;li&gt;School hasn&apos;t even started yet and things are getting really busy.  IEEEEEE
&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;On Saturday, &lt;a href=&quot;http://users.livejournal.com/users/fios&quot;&gt;Jay P&lt;/a&gt; and I went to the OARC&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://oarc.net/fleamarket/index.html&quot;&gt;Hamfest&lt;/a&gt;.  I&apos;ll admit it was hardcore geeky in that we were more than likely the youngest licensed hams out of probably a good 200 people.  Now that shows you how old the average age of the people in this hobby is.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;My pastor stepped down from his leadership position on Friday night.  I feel sorta lost as we probably won&apos;t see him until he figures out what he&apos;s going to do next.  Please pray for me and my church family.  I&apos;m confident that the timing of this is all God&apos;s doing and that He will really step things up so that we can fulfill the vision that he has given us.  Church website &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlc.org&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for those interested.</pre>
