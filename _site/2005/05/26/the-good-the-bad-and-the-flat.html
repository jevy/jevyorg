<p>Two stories for today. One good, one stinking stupid (not my fault this time I swear):</p>
<ul>
	<li>I really enjoy biking along the canal on non-windy days.  Before I left, I showed Caleb (my roomie) the seam splitting on my tire.  "You should get that checked out because it sucks to get stranded".  "Whatever" I thought "it's got awhile left I'm sure".  Sure enough half-way home: *PPFFFFTTTTTTT* *flap flap flap*.  Wow... don't I feel like an idiot.  Walked my bike for about half an hour with the people who I just passed smirking back at me.  I had seen earlier in the week a bike shop behind a guy's house right by my place so I figured that would be close enough.  Knocked on the door and was greeted by a lovely older guy who felt really bad for my tire dying in the middle of the canal.  On the way out I mentioned I liked the scripture that he had out front of his place and in his shop.  He got super excited to meet another Christian and started going off for about 15 minutes about the body of Christ (referring to Christians working together and complimenting each other in our gifts and abilities).  He said that no one but Christians will ever say anything about the verses but he often sees people reading the verses out in his yard if you don't look directly at them while they read it.  I thought that was funny.  Anyways, picked my bike up today and it was fixed beautifully and he explained how to maintain the new tire and tube etc.  If we have a house warming party I hope to invite him and his family.  That would be grand!</li>

	<li>We had a good time last night at Second Cup and Bank and Second.  Although caffeine does a number on me and couldn't get to sleep until late (ugh).  We were standing outside the coffee shop at about 10:30 saying our goodbyes when we heard a car driving south on bank: *PAFFF*.  I thought it was it backfiring but we heard Marina scream.  A paintball hit her in the ear.  What kind of person does that?  I ran up to the cop at the next set of lights and he took off after him.  Noone really thought to notice what the car looked like until much later so I doubt he caught them.  Still, I was in shock that people would do this type of thing.</li>
