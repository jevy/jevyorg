<p>Just moved in to the new place yesterday. So nice! Semi-quiet neighbourhood only a few minutes from the Market. I&#8217;ll post pictures in the next couple of days of the place and am sure we&#8217;ll be having a house warming party sometime soon.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve become quite content with my summer setup. I&#8217;ve got a bunch of stuff setup for the evenings to get together with people. Two solid opportunities to get some good (and fun) engineering experience and both on my own time! Nothing like being flexible and getting up at 9:30am (man, just typing that makes me feel lazy). I feel unqualified for most of this stuff but this summer will be a serious test in self-motivation which I think is a good trait in itself to develop. Anyways, see you once I get internet at home&#8230;</p>
