<p>So here&#8217;s a little update I suppose: <ul>
	<li>Moving downtown on Sunday to a sweet apartment with a friend of mine from school - Caleb.  I'd love for everyone to come on down to check it out and head to the Market or something.</li>
	<li>Work is still an odd thing.  I'm working part-time for <a href='http://www.radialink.com'>Radialink</a> learning all I can about the Linux kernel and iptables.  It's pretty daunting to start with from really not terribly much programming experience.  That _should_ turn into a fulltime job for July/Aug.  I'm volunteering the rest of my time at <a href='http://www.carleton.ca'>Carleton </a>in the robotics lab playing with stuff there.  Also will be lots of fun but I need to make a structure of what I'm actually going to do.</li>
	<li>Yipes!  It's two weeks and some into summer!  I need to get moving on stuff</li>
	<li>Laughing with good 'ol friends = a solid time.. always</li>
</ul></p>
