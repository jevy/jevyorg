<p>Well I&#8217;ve spent 10 hours on the same freakin&#8217; problem on my QNX development system with no luck. I have a headache and I just want to take a nap. Putting my heart and soul in my project will be awesome once I get a system working that I can actually start to work on.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m just ranting.</p>

<p>Oh yeah! On a good note, internet&#8217;s showing up at my place on Friday. Nicceeeee</p>
