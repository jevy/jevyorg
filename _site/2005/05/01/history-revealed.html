<p>So Grandma stayed at our plaec for a couple of days this week so I was finally able to ask her a bit about my heritage. So here is the final results <em>tadda!</em>:</p>

<p>50% - Maltais - French Canadian (from France). Still have to figure out which generation 25% - Davidson - Scottish - 5th or 6th generation 25% - Kinney - Irish - Likely 5th generation</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad I finally know this. So I am now taking invitations to join a french/irish/scottish mafia somewhere. Please address them to Jevin.</p>

<p>I also found out the names of my grandma&#8217;s uncles who died from the gas in Ypres: Bob and Nelson Davidson.</p>
