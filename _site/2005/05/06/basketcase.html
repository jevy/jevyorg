<p>It started when I was watching the Notebook a couple of months ago when I got to the end and I literally wanted to throw up. Like vomit into the garbage can that I had next to me. My stomach was turning upside down and I couldn&#8217;t figure out why. Then tonight was the Series finale of Third Watch. Awesome series by the way, the characterization and writing is very good. Anyways, we get to the end and they were saying where everyone ended up in life and it came over me again, wanting to throw up. I was getting frustrated that I couldn&#8217;t figure it out.</p>

<p>I went upstairs to ask mom (yeah yeah) what the heck was going on. Ask talking about it, I truly feel since I somehow supress myself from crying, my emotions come up through my stomach. Thinking about it, it makes sense! If I shead a single tear so a series finale or for a cheesy chick flick I would honestly feel like less of a man. How stupid is that! Society is telling me I&#8217;m less of a man is I have compassion or feel something for people, even if it&#8217;s fiction!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m finding that I attach and emerse myself in these shows/movies fairly easily. I&#8217;m wondering if that&#8217;s not such a bad thing. If I live for awhile, might aswell feel things deeper than not at all. How does that quote go? &#8220;Better to have loved and been hurt then to never have loved at all&#8221;. Just so long as I&#8217;m secure with who I am as a person and secure with who I am in Christ then these emotions are all good.</p>

<p>Man, I don&#8217;t even know what this all means.</p>
