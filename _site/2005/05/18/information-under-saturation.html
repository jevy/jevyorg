<p>Well, I called <a href='http://www.get3web.com'>3web</a> today and we&#8217;re potentially looking at another week without internet. That sucks. On the bright side I can do other productive stuff like.. errr&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll probably think of something. The lab work is pretty interesting actually, I&#8217;m working with embedded systems that will be used in the robots built here. Not much in other news.</p>

<p>I guess new contact info is imporant: Home phone (613) 236-7341 Cell (same as always) Lab: 520-2600 x2600</p>
