<p>Could it be?</p>

<p>I went out tonight from a musical put on by some high schoolers at the Bronson Centre on well.. Bronson. When I got home Caleb was sitting outside listening to some quiet trance music inside. I go into my room to start reading when Phil Collins comes on (I love Phil). Caleb comes inside and changes it to another Trance set. By this point I felt good.</p>

<p>I come out a while later to clean the dishes and just then Caleb&#8217;s getting into it! Kinda throwing his fist in the ear just as the beat kicks in and tapping his foot. He&#8217;s going to read this and be in denial, but I know the truth and all these people reading this know the truth because I&#8217;m the most trustworthy person in the world! &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; or not</p>
