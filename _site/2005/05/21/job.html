<p>I&#8217;m still undecided if I want a job or not. The main reason for a job is to get STINKING MOTIVATED and to simply meet people. I was thinking that being a cook in some local pub somewhere would be cool. It would be super busy (love it), intense (I love the pressure), can work on my cooking skillz (if only I had nunchuck or computer hacking skillz), and meet a wide variety of cats. Maybe? We&#8217;ll see how things pan out this week.</p>
