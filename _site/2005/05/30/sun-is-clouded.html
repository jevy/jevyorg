<p>Things are going remarkably well these days. I&#8217;ve spent nearly every weekday in the lab and just got an email from my prof saying that I have &#8220;talent&#8221;. Wow! I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been called tallented in anything really before. He&#8217;s going to try to work me into a job for the Engineering department or at the very least get me an official research grant for the rest of the summer. I really wasn&#8217;t expecting any payment for this stuff (not that I have it yet but am hopeful) but I&#8217;ve been praying nearly everyday that God would lead this entire summer. Believe what you will but I&#8217;m confident he&#8217;s got his hand on this situation.</p>

<p>The apartment&#8217;s great! Located in a really nice area local to a lot of stuff. I would post some pics but I don&#8217;t know where my usb cable for my camera is :P.</p>
