<p>I&#8217;m stuck &#8211; or so it feels like anyways. Very few companies (that I&#8217;ve seen) will even talk to anyone who is not in co-op. It&#8217;s my fault for not applying last year and I called them up today and they say I cannot get into the program as I&#8217;m to far into the program. I don&#8217;t have the marks needed that will put me above the cut and I don&#8217;t have the industry experience to land me most jobs. So where do I go from here?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got my applications in a couple of places but now I&#8217;m really not feeling confident about this stuff. Perhaps volunteering to do research for a professor or something? Maybe even take classes this summer and try for a fall or winter placement somewhere? Ugh&#8230;</p>
