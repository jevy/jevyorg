<p>HAHA! Great article written by &#8220;The Christian guy who was on the Bachelorette&#8221;. Why is so insane when Christian guys say that they&#8217;re virgins. Jevy&#8217;s a virgin and proud of it. So much in fact that I&#8217;m going to give props to all those guys out there who are virgins are proud:</p>
