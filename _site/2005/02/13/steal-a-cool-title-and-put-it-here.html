<p>I really desire creativity. If someone knows where it comes from, let me know and I&#8217;ll buy it online. ;) Trying to come up with something fresh for my website. So hard to do! Trying to write some music that doesn&#8217;t sound like something else. Stinking rough! Come up with some fashionable style of my own? Well, I&#8217;ve got jeans and a hoodie on now so I&#8217;m on my way. Telling my own jokes? Well, I don&#8217;t really.. I just talk about life and people seem to enjoy that haha.</p>

<p>Really though. I feel I need to <em>justify</em> my lack of creativity or something. Does that even make sense? &#8220;How many people actually write creative music, not many, so I shouldn&#8217;t feel bad&#8221;. Maybe I&#8217;m just looking for a new way to express myself. I&#8217;m definitely feeling the imbalance of my brain these days. The left is screaming for a break while the right is turning to mush&#8230; or something.</p>
