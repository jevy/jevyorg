<p>So I like the idea of a challenge. I don&#8217;t mind giving my all for this project for another 5 days. I can deal.</p>

<p>The bible is a solid book. I really want to learn it more so that I can share and understand for myself what He might do/say in a particular situation and it&#8217;s not just my ideas/concepts. Even if you&#8217;re not a Christian it&#8217;s a good read.</p>
