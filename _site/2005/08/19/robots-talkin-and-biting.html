<p>So I spent 10am-1am with about 2 hours of break on Wed night finishing up the robots. I made a video of how I progressed which I&#8217;ll compile and post soon.</p>

<p>They loved my presentation. I&#8217;m going to be presenting again for the Dean at 2:30pm on Monday but that should be fine as these programs have already worked well under pressure ;) I&#8217;ll also post of the robots doing stuff a bit later.</p>
