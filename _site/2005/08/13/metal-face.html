<p>So I had a nightmare the other night that while I was soldering, I got <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering'>solder </a>in my eye. I didn&#8217;t anything of it so I left it there. Anyways, it started rusting, I went blind in the eye, then the other. I don&#8217;t remember the rest but I probably died somehow.</p>

<p>.. so now I wear goggles.</p>
