<p>As a Christian, I am called to love everyone. As such, homophobia is such a terrible thing to reject people based on there sexual preference. I also believe that God&#8217;s Word is perfect and complete, and while the bible says that homosexuality is not right, I love the person regardless and accept where they are at. I&#8217;m not trying to start an argument but wanted to be open about where I&#8217;m at.</p>
<!--cut=Stop Homophobia!!!-->
<p>Homophobia and You:</p>

<p>I am the girl kicked out of her home because I confided in my mother that I am a lesbian.</p>

<p>I am the prostitute working the streets because nobody will hire a transsexual woman.</p>

<p>I am the sister who holds her gay brother tight through the painful, tear-filled nights.</p>

<p>We are the parents who buried our daughter long before her time.</p>

<p>I am the man who died alone in the hospital because they would not let my partner of twenty-seven years into the room.</p>

<p>I am the foster child who wakes up with nightmares of being taken away from the two fathers who are the only loving family I have ever had. I wish they could adopt me.</p>

<p>I am one of the lucky ones, I guess. I survived the attack that left me in a coma for three weeks, and in another year I will probably be able to walk again.</p>

<p>I am not one of the lucky ones. I killed myself just weeks before graduating high school. It was simply too much to bear.</p>

<p>We are the couple who had the realtor hang up on us when she found out we wanted to rent a one-bedroom for two men.</p>

<p>I am the person who never knows which bathroom I should use if I want to avoid getting the management called on me.</p>

<p>I am the mother who is not allowed to even visit the children I bore, nursed, and raised. The court says I am an unfit mother because I now live with another woman.</p>

<p>I am the domestic-violence survivor who found the support system grow suddenly cold and distant when they found out my abusive partner is also a woman.</p>

<p>I am the domestic-violence survivor who has no support system to turn to because I am male.</p>

<p>I am the father who has never hugged his son because I grew up afraid to show affection to other men.</p>

<p>I am the home-economics teacher who always wanted to teach gym until someone told me that only lesbians do that.</p>

<p>I am the man who died when the paramedics stopped treating me as soon as they realized I was transsexual.</p>

<p>I am the person who feels guilty because I think I could be a much better person if I did not have to always deal with society hating me.</p>

<p>I am the man who stopped attending church, not because I don&#8217;t believe, but because they closed their doors to my kind.</p>

<p>I am the person who has to hide what this world needs most, love.</p>

<p>I am the person who is afraid of telling his loving Christian parents he loves another male.</p>

<p>Re-post this if you believe homophobia is wrong. Please do your part to end it. <!--/cut--></p>
