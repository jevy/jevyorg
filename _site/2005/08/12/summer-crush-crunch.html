<p>Crunch time in the summer should be illegal. I&#8217;m really enjoying my job until the pressure builds then it&#8217;s just like an assignment that needs to get done. Thing is, this assignment needs 100% on it (by Thursday) or I fail (well not <em>really</em>). Thursday is when I&#8217;m presenting the final product to the Dean and there&#8217;s still tons to get done. UGH</p>

<p>In other news, life is good!</p>
