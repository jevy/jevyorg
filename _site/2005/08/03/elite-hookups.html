<p>Why is it that celebraties only hook up with celebrities? Is it that the famous class has all the really nice and ambitious people that have the ability to raise a family? Or is it that they simply don&#8217;t associate with any of the not-so-famous class after they get rich? Reason I ask is I saw Sheryl Crow with her boyfriend Lance Armstrong on Oprah (not that I know.. err&#8230; watch).</p>
