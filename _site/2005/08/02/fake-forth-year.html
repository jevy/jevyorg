<p>IEEEEEE. So it&#8217;s time to pick classes etc. Usually the most fun part of the year as you can highly optimize and pack classes as not to waste time. So I&#8217;m taking five years of school right? Well, the problem is, since I haven&#8217;t finished all the third year classes, I&#8217;m not considered a fourth year student. Whatever, I don&#8217;t mind being at the same class of people who I&#8217;ve already taken most of their classes. Problem is, until I finish the third year classes I can&#8217;t take fourth year classes!!</p>

<p>&#8230; so, I was hoping that my nice guy skills would swoon the Engineering Admin Ladies: Jevin: G&#8217;Afternoon ladies Ladies: Hi! Jevin: Blah blah blah.. fourth year.. not all courses done&#8230; blah blah blah&#8230; what do you guys recommend? Ladies: See that orange piece of paper? Go to that website, it&#8217;s all online.</p>

<p>SHOOT! How am I going to swoon a website. Time to grovel in the &#8220;reason for exception&#8221; form. Please pray. :S</p>
