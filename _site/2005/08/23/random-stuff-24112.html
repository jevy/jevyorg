	&lt;li&gt;Played my last game of ultimate with the &quot;Dirty Little Devils&quot;.  We got smoked _hard_.  I was talking to the team later on and some of them had been playing 10 years.  10 years?  Why the heck are you in the worst tier if you&apos;ve been playing 10 years?  I&apos;m sad that I won&apos;t be playing again until the winter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Heading to NYC tomorrow.  Don&apos;t have much planned.  I am planning on getting a fake Rollex in China town ;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119008/&quot;&gt;Donnie Brasco&lt;/a&gt; was on tonight.  Decent movie!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Normally I hate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000131/&quot;&gt;John Cusack&lt;/a&gt; but he really ripped it up in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146882/&quot;&gt;High Fidelity&lt;/a&gt;.  Watching it a second time I really caught the bigger picture.  Ladies: if you want to know how a guy thinks, this is it.  Don&apos;t just look to the superficial &quot;did-you-sleep-with-him-yet?&quot; lines, ask yourself what he&apos;s _realllly_ asking.  HA!  Mind games!!!!!!!</pre>
