<p>I&#8217;m at my parents&#8217; place today after a 2 day CRU servant team retreat. I&#8217;m not even moved back yet and my mom came upstairs giving me a 15 minute ultimatum to throw the granola bar wrapper that I left next to the couch in the garbage.</p>
<blockquote>
Me: "Why in 15 minutes?"
Mom: "Because we need room for your stuff."
Me: "But we're doing that after dinner!"
Mom: "The wrapper needs to get thrown out now <em>please</em>"
</blockquote>
<p>Man.. the price you pay for living with your parents. Regardless, I still think it&#8217;s a sweet deal.</p>
