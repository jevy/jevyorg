<p>Wow. I know I&#8217;m the greatest poker player but first one out of the 15 people that played? <a href='http://www.livejournal.com/users/skofz/'>James</a>&#8217; party was pretty fun but it&#8217;s odd when you don&#8217;t really know the majority of the people. That&#8217;s really lame. Maybe I should just face the facts. I&#8217;M A TERRIBLE GAMBLER. Or maybe God&#8217;s trying to tell me something (?).</p>

<p>Church today was awesome! Taka painted a picture from the book of Revelation (leadership stuff in Revelation?) of what Spirit lead leadership should look like. I&#8217;m debating on volunteering putting them up on our website so other people can benefit from his messages. SOOOO GOOD!</p>
