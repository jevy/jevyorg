<p>This humidity is killer. Really though, it really makes you feel alive. There really isn&#8217;t anything like sweating like a maple tree and cracking the beer in the afternoon. My roomie&#8217;s making fajitas and the dance music is pumping in my room. Somehow it all seems to work.</p>

<p>I have so many things that I want to &#8220;start&#8221; this summer but feel that I can&#8217;t until I get other stuff off my place. I want to let it all slide until the end of the summer but my gut knows that that would be bad news.</p>
