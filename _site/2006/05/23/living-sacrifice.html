<p>It&#8217;s 100% <a href='http://www.ocua.ca'>Ultimate </a>season and I absolutely love it. Everything! The effort, sweat, my team (one dude LOVES <a href='http://www.di.fm/trance/'>Trance</a>!!), the beer afterwards and being the baby of the team. My back is shot for some reason but I now remember the importance of stretching (thanks gym teachers from elementary school!). I&#8217;ll maybe take some pictures next week. We&#8217;re won our two first games, 15-9 then 11-8 tonight. Granted for those last couple of points, the other team was down a player but hey.</p>

<p>Anyways, it&#8217;s going to be a great season I&#8217;m sure if people stick around.</p>
