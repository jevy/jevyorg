<p>Well, the three of us moved into our new (well, 1930s new) place over the weekend. It&#8217;s going to be a blast I&#8217;m sure. Things are slow to get organized. Without the internet and phoneline there isn&#8217;t too much to do in spare time (that&#8217;s a complete lie really). Between the CBC and CTV which we get on the antenna, I was forced to watch the budget (&#8220;Is there more? MORE MORE!&#8221;) being released after I got home from work. Oh well.</p>

<p>Work is starting out pretty slow. These first days are slow getting everything setup but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be off to the races soon enough. My team <em>is</em> young and fun. They&#8217;re a funny bunch for sure. This getting up at 6:35 every morning will take some getting used to though. <em>le sigh</em></p>
