<p>Here are some random things for your entertainment: <ul>
	<li>Okay, when I said we didn't really have stuff working in our place.  It's for one main reason: THE POWER OUTLETS ARE ONLY TWO PRONGS!  So computers and other equipment are out.  So the past two days I've been trying to watch Oprah and Dr. Phil on the two channels we can barely make out through the antenna.  I for sure have a dependence on the internet.  Not really bad as I need it for working and coordinating my social life.</li>
	<li>Went to the local confectionery to pick up some bus tickets with Kin.  The guy at the counter was cool.  I introduced myself and told him we just moved here.  He then got excited and told me that if I ever need protection that he'd be my bodyguard and that I just needed to call 911.  He proceeded to talk about some movie and snack deals he had going on but he confused himself so i really have no idea what they are.  I heard 99 cents and 3.99 in there so it must be good deals (?).</li>
	<li>Got caught biking in the rain yesterday.  STINK!  I only have to bike for 15 minutes and it started JUST when I left.  I was angry initially but then laughed it off you see other people smiling and walking their dogs and don't care.</li>
	<li>Everything you've heard and imagined about government and cubicles are true:</li>
<ul>
	<li>30 minutes of work, 15 minute break: TRUE</li>
	<li>Dilbert on cubicle walls: TRUE</li>
	<li>Various cubicle toys (Nerf guns or other projectiles): TRUE</li>
	<li>A manager always off to meetings: TRUE</li>
	<li>Things getting stuck in bureaucracy: TRUE (only from what I overhear)</li>
</ul>
