<p>So I got an email from a high school teacher (Mr. D - remember <a href='http://jevy.org/photos/v/album/teachers+001.jpg.html?'>him</a>?) inviting me a wake for my OA Physics teacher&#8217;s mom (Flo). Since it was a short bus ride down the street I decided to go. I met Zbit&#8217;s (the teacher&#8217;s nickname) whole family and they expressed their appreciation for me being there.</p>

<p>The weirdest thing though was how she died. Apparently Mr. D was visiting in the hospital and knew the Zbit&#8217;s mom quite well. <blockquote><strong>Mr. D</strong>: Right, so I had just gotten there and we were visiting Flo.  A bunch of us left for a few minutes.  I walked back into the room a few minutes later and noticed that Flo was heaving and wheezing really badly.
<strong>Me</strong>: Yeesh.
<strong>Mr. D</strong>: So I had seen this two or three times before and I knew this meant it was the end.  So I gently put my arm behind her and lifted her up a bit and said to her: "It's okay Flo, you can let go now".
<strong>Me</strong>: Uhhhh
<strong>Mr. D</strong>: With that she took three of four deep breaths and that was it.
* Long pause *
<strong>Me</strong>: Well sir, that's one part incredibly beautiful, one part really creepy.</blockquote> Can you imagine? Holding someone in your arms as they gently go to sleep? I guess that would be a nice way to go, being held as you go. Quite a contrast with J.C. who died with nails through sensitive parts of him body, not held by anyone with His father turning his face away completely from Him. Harsh.</p>

<p>Turns out Flo was a hardcore prayer warrior that the priests wouldn&#8217;t even take on. Whoa! That <em>is</em> hardcore.</p>
