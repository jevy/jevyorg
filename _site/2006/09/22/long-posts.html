<p>I have to be honest  I don't care if we're super tight friends but if I get any inkling that your post is a this-is-what-I-did-today-because-you-probably-don't-care type of post.  I more than likely read it.  Give me a story, give me your emotions about your day.  That's what I'm mostly interested in.
