<p>In the hopes of upgrading my site, I just put up a photoblog. This is more my artistic or single picture stories while my photo album will be a collection of pictures from events. New pictures coming out every 2 or so days. Please leave comments! I&#8217;m trying to improve. <a href='http://jevy.org/gallery'>http://jevy.org/gallery</a></p>

<p>and for those technically minded (or just organized), here&#8217;s the RSS feed: http://jevy.org/gallery/index.php?x=rss</p>
