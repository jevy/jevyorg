<p>I was talking with my brother on the phone today and I just started crying. I realized something in my heart that was wrong and I apologized to him. Weird thing is, I didn&#8217;t feel anything until I actually spoke it to him. This healing feels kinda good! Well afterwards anyways.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m so vulnerable.</p>

<p>A great ultimate game really helped.</p>
