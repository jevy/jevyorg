<p>The Narnia Score and Soundtrack is incredible (Evacuating London being my favorite tune). I&#8217;m torn between buying the soundtrack or the movie since they&#8217;re close to the same price. I still maintain that <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004581/'>Harry Gregson-Williams</a> is the most talented composer for movies around. He.. and well.. <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001877/'>Hans Zimmer</a>.</p>
