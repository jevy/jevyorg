<p>This whole CD is fantastic. Some people are sold on lyrics (usually I could care less about the words if the music is quality). If I <a href='http://jevy.org/2006/04/24/the-itunes-bug/'>haven't convinced</a> you, this is from Weekend Players - Pursuit of Happiness: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;we&apos;re in pursuit of happiness
order of the day
and we&apos;re on, on a mission to make it true
we do it most every day</pre></p>

<p>step back and look where you are move away from the grey clouds passin&#8217; by keep strong and it won&#8217;t be long until there&#8217;s better times</p>

<p>and we&#8217;re feelin&#8217; all right we&#8217;re driftin&#8217; on by and we&#8217;re feelin&#8217; all right we&#8217;re driftin&#8217; on by</p>

<p>we&#8217;re all needin&#8217; much the same in order, order to live i know, no one said it wasn&#8217;t hard to get back what you give&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
