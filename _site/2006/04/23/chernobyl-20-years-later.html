<p>I have almost been facinated by the Chernobyl disaster. I&#8217;m not sure why really. Maybe how a split second can have devistating effects for hundreds of years. Maybe I just like ghost towns. There are websites and photoblogs posted all over the place for the 20th anniversary of the disaster. I&#8217;ve blogged <a href='http://www.kiddofspeed.com/chapter1.html'>this site</a> before which is the best I&#8217;ve seen. One that <a href='http://www.pixelpress.org/chernobyl/index.html'>I just spotted</a> on boingboing is good. Warning: Graphic.</p>
