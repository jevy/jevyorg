<p>Racism is somewhat of a weird concept to me I think. I mean, I more than likely hold my own stereotypes about certain people groups, but to see anything actually being acted out I have never experienced. While in <a href='http://www2.occdsb.on.ca/mth/'>St. Matt's</a>, I would hear that there were some pretty big racial issues going on. Maybe I didn&#8217;t see them because I was part of the 90% majority. Maybe suburbia isn&#8217;t the greatest place after all. :(</p>
