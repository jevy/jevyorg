<p>So, we&#8217;re picking up the keys to the new apartment tomorrow. Normally it&#8217;s not a big deal but now that I&#8217;m out for the whole year for the first time I decided to put together a list (on here) of things I&#8217;ll miss and be glad about.</p>

<p>Things I won&#8217;t miss: <ul>
	<li>2 hours on the bus everyday (got lots of reading done though)</li>
	<li>My brother playing the drums SO LOUD at the most inconvenient times.</li>
	<li>Being relatively far away from the "action" of downtown and my Carleton peeps</li>
	<li>Being able to try some new foods out.</li>
	<li>Not being able to use my bike to get places.</li>
</ul> Things I will miss: <ul>
	<li>Daily advice I could get from mom/dad/brother.</li>
	<li>Food at the table consistantly that I didn't have to really.. err.. make</li>
	<li>A clean house that I don't have to pay rent for or worry about electricity costs.</li>
	<li>Quick access to a car to whip around to run arrands.</li>
</ul></p>
