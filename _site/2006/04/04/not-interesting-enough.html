<p>Since I don&#8217;t really think I have much interesting stuff to make a real post. How about some point form stuff? <ul>
	<li>Maggie and I headed down by bus (so cheap!) to Montreal for a couple of days to visit my buds Brad, Tara (and Nora too!).  It was an absolute blast to just sit around and eat with some really solid people.</li>
	<li>I spent Monday evening over at a couple's place from church.  Les was my youth leader at our old church when I was in Junior high.  Her husband is this big loud Texan guy who is probably one of the wisest guys I know and won't let you answer a serious question without looking him in the eyes.  They both come to Newlife now.  He is a hilarious guy too.  Anyways, they wanted to hear about where I'm at with my spiritual journey as well as any frustrations about ministry and the church.  I was touched by their concern and genuine desire to see me healed and to really meet me where I was at.  My the end of it, I didn't want to leave their place.  Maybe it was because we ate too much Indian food. ;D</li>
	<li>I wish we could finish our classes with everyone else.  I still have two classes on Thursday.</li>
	<li>The 97xx series buses are for sure the most poorly designed buses in the OC fleet.  Why are their seats in the back facing each other?  Are people doing conferences on the bus?  Why would you ever have the door open by "wave your hand here".  Is a bar or button passe?</li>
