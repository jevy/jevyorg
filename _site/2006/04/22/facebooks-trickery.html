<p>So I got a Facebook account the other day since someone asked me &#8220;soo what&#8217;s your facebook account?&#8221; obviously assuming that I already had one because a) I&#8217;m at university b) I was alive.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve given it a couple of weeks but Dave <a href='http://luongsass.blogspot.com/2006/04/facebook.html'>beat me</a> to the chase. It&#8217;s totally an ego booster. Why is it that a girl from high school, who graduated a year after me, who&#8217;s brother I hung out with in elementary school added me as a &#8220;friend&#8221;. Initially when I saw this, I was happy to have another &#8220;friend&#8221;. What? How am I a friend to this person, I talked to them maybe twice in my life. So really, what is the point of listing people as friends. Kev posted a great link <a href='http://www.kevlam.net/2006/03/27/trendspotting-myspace/'>here </a>to an evaluation of the new &#8220;social networking&#8221; scene. I personally feel it&#8217;s an ego booster. Why else would the front page of my login say: &#8220;You are connected to 4361 people through your networks.&#8221; Yehaw! I&#8217;m the most popular guy ever! Yeah right..</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m off to bed.. after I check for new messages on facebook.</p>
