<p>Just got a call from mom tonight that my uncle is in critical condition. He has cancer and it spread from his liver and he has had adverse effects from the chemotherapy. He&#8217;s probably one of the most driven people I have ever met (I&#8217;m not particularly close with him) and is an oil lawyer in Dubai.</p>

<p>I wonder what you think about when death is staring right at you smirking. I&#8217;m sure life does flash before your eyes realizing that it hasn&#8217;t been long enough. What about the future? Is he thinking about if it was all worth it? Is he thinking about God? Maybe now he can think about God.. too bad it has to come to this point before that happens.</p>
