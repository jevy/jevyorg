<p>I haven&#8217;t had the time to really post about the incredible weekend I had down in Port Colborne this past week so instead I&#8217;ll just rip off my friend Arjun&#8217;s <a href='http://www.xanga.com/mrmehta/495846309/item.html'>post </a>(I hope he doesn&#8217;t mind?) as it&#8217;s exactly how I feel! <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Diary,</pre></p>

<p>The past week deserves to be written about. I really don&#8217;t know where to start though. Essentially, I spent time with the coolest people throughout.</p>

<p>What more can I say?</p>

<p>Inspiration, Company, Lists, Friends, Love and Peace.&lt;/blockquote&gt; So I&#8217;ll be posting more pictures from the weekend in a little while but for now I can share about what the deal was. So I went down to check out Operation Mobilization, a Christian mission organization that works all across the world, to see how good of a fit it would be to work with them for a year or so. These people are absolutely incredible and inspiring which I recognized right away. JJ, a mechanic from northern Alberta and I stayed at this couple&#8217;s house who were probably about 65 or so. I have never heard so many stories over a period of 5 days in my life. One after the other about how God pulls off incredible things in this family&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>So the whole point is this, I really feel the need to move forward spiritually by tangibly putting more faith in the Lord in all aspects of my life. How about this example. A missionary in the 1800s feels God is calling him to start up an orphanage. Everyday, the guy cleans up the kids for dinner, sits them all down and prays that food will be on the table. Just then (like everyday?) someone (different everyday) shows up with groceries or a meal ready to go. I don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re skeptical of this actually happening (I am too!), but I can say that it&#8217;s happened in varying degrees in my own life but not to that extreme. I&#8217;m not talking about things that are mere cool coincidences, but things that you just have to step back and say &#8220;whoa, no WAY!&#8221;. How cool would it be to have a lifestyle where you constantly depend on something extrinsic of yourself and have things &#8220;just work out&#8221;. I believe we were designed to live like this. Now it&#8217;s just a matter of figuring out how.</p>

<p>Love and Peace,</p>
