Glad I didn't go see <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365737/'>this one</a> in theatres.  While in the end the point came together in an interesting way, it took the whole movie to get to that point.  So if you're going to watch it, turn it on and leave for the first hour and come back for the interesting part.  Wait, then the movie wouldn't make sense.  So, if you're interesting political issues I would recommend this movie.  I wasn't in the greatest of moods when I watched the first half but enjoyed the last half.  It's not pro left or right, just the facts.
