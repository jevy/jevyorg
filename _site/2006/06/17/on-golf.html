<p>So I faired alright (pun intended) on Thursday at the golf tournament at work. My hits were wildly inconsistent but got better towards the end of the day. My putting is terrible (despite years of mini-putt), my driving has power but slices like no tomorrow and my short game is probably the best thing I have going on! I love my 5 iron. It was kinda cool playing with my grandpa&#8217;s clubs that he used every day for many many years. I felt like I was carrying a torch or something.</p>

<p>The only reason I think people like golf is that you get out of the house for 4-5 hours and you think about nothing other than golf. It&#8217;s an escape! Personally, I don&#8217;t want to commit an entire afternoon to a sport. Instead, I like games where you get in there and get it done.. like&#8230; squash or ultimate! On top of that, I thought it would be a really relaxing time. IT&#8217;S NOT AT ALL! Talk about stress and pressure. Sheesh!</p>

<p>.. back to video games for me!</p>
