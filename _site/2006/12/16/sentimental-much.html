<p>In the past couple of days I&#8217;ve hunted down a stack of friends from elementary school on Facebook. Memories came flooding back of the simpler days. This got me thinking: I find that with most people in my life, I&#8217;m the one that tends to try to keep relationships alive or at the very least, try to maintain a certain amount of contact. Maybe I live in the past, maybe I have a heard time visualizing the future. For whatever reason, memories that I have cherish to the nth degree.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think that other people don&#8217;t do the same or don&#8217;t even care about the times we had together. A good example was our &#8220;high school reunion&#8221; months back. Now, it wasn&#8217;t a real high-school reunion, but I love any opportunity to see old teachers and friends that you had back in the day to just talk about stuff from before. I&#8217;m trying to hate on people for not coming, but I was <em>the only one</em> from my class (that&#8217;s <a href='http://fios.livejournal.com/'>Jay </a>for showing up when I was leaving lol). Anyways, just some thoughts.</p>
