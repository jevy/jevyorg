<p>A stack of us from Carleton went out to see the Nutcracker last night at the NAC. I have to admit that I don&#8217;t recall ever seeing a ballet before so I figured it would be a good way to get other there and become more cultured. It was fun! I enjoyed watching the kids in the audience with their &#8220;oohhhhh&#8221; and &#8220;ahhhhhhhh&#8221; reactions. Anyways, I think Swan Lake is up next time ;)</p>
