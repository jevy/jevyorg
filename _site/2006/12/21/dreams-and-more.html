<p>So there desiring to learn about about God works. I see stuff in the bible that I don&#8217;t see going on much anymore. If it really is the same God, shouldn&#8217;t He be doing the same stuff?</p>

<p>Anyways, a couple of weeks ago, this Christian guy from Montreal came down to Ottawa to teach on dreams, their significance and how to interpret them. Incredible stuff! I didn&#8217;t realize how much the bible put an emphasis on dreams. Anyways, so I started my own little wiki using <a href='http://www.tiddlywiki.com/'>TiddlyWiki </a>to record my own dreams and the interpretations and I work through them. If you have a dream you want to share, I need practice interpreting and I&#8217;d love to try it. Not guarantees but I&#8217;d like to try. Emailing me is probably best: jevin@techie.com.</p>
