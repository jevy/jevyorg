<p>Google rocks. What is there left to say. We&#8217;ve all been using their search engine exclusively for years. Now I&#8217;ve forwarded all my email to gmail and even <a href='http://jevy.org/2006/11/21/organized-email/'>bragged </a>about how efficient it is. I use <a href='http://maps.google.com'>Google Maps</a> exclusively for maps. Yesterday I was getting fed up with Bloglines and their RSS reader so I decided to give <a href='http://reader.google.com'>Google Reader</a> a shot. Absolute glory. I was sold in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s the problem, Google could destroy my life if it wanted to know. It knows everything I read, all my friends, all my most personal email &#8211; everything! I don&#8217;t really like to admit that an other commercial entity has the power to own me but it&#8217;s true. Oh well, I guess that deserve it?</p>
