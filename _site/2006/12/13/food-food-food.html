<p>Okay, food is seriously all I can think of these days. I eat all day long. The thing is, the options are mega limited about what I can eat because of this whole Candida thing. I&#8217;m seeing my naturopathic doctor tomorrow morning to see what I can re-introduce in my diet. Anyways, I had some time tonight and wanted to try something new so I whipped together this great (and simple) <a href='http://www.recipezaar.com/25360'>Chickpea Curry</a>. It&#8217;s so frustrating not being able to eat what you want anymore. My mom has always said &#8220;I wish I could eat anything I want just like you&#8221;. Well, now I guess I can understand where she&#8217;s coming from.</p>

<p>Anyways, time to grab some of my organic chips! Yum Yummy!</p>
