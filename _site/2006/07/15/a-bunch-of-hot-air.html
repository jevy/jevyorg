<p>On Wednesday a bunch of us from work head down to <a href='http://www.ottawabluesfest.ca/en/'>Bluesfest </a>to check out Mobile, Nelly Furtado and Live. I swear all of Carleton University was there.</p>

<p>Mobile - Okay whatever. They&#8217;re trying to gain some popularity it was cool to see them but I was more excited for the following two acts.</p>

<p>Nelly Furtado - So what the heck is up with Ottawa crowds? The feeling I get from crowds it that they want to show up just to say that they went to X concert and that they&#8217;d be happy is everyone played only one song each. When Nelly first came on people were pumped but after five minutes, it returned to normal. Too bad because she played some very danceable stuff. She opened up with I think my favorite song by her off her new CD: &#8220;Say it right&#8221;. HUGE BEAT!</p>

<p>Live - After Nelly the teenie boppers all cleared out to basically those who were college age and above. These guys are great and you can tell they just love music. I owned their CD Throwing Copper years ago and still tops one of my favorite CDs. They were pushing their newer stuff which no one really knew but then easy mixed in some of their older stuff. Right before I ran into Luong and Lindsey. Right next to him was a co-op from work. Behind me a girl from some of my Systems classes. To my front left a first year Systems Eng student from CRU. Towards the back of the crowd another guy from CRU. Nice!</p>
