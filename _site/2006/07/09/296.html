<p>Anyways, the movie. Yeah, I ended up having to rent it by myself which was fine since it&#8217;s been a long week and I was going to visit with my parents as I haven&#8217;t seen them in a couple of weeks. Some people will hate that movie, and that&#8217;s fine.. just don&#8217;t talk to me about it then ;)</p>
