<p>I hear about people complaining about how their &#8220;alarm clocks didn&#8217;t work&#8221; etc etc. I find this such a lame excuse until it happened to me. I then realized, wow.. alarm clocks DO work, it&#8217;s just that we can&#8217;t figure out how to operate them. So here are the possible situations: <ul>
	<li>The time is set properly, the alarm ime is set properly and the alarm is turned on.  The alarm then wakes you up as expected.</li>
	<li>The above happens but the snooze button is pressed repeatedly, causing the safe effect as if the alarm never went off in the first place.</li>
	<li>The alarm volume was set to low so you didn't hear your favorite Britney Spears song to wake you up. (What happened to me, but it was on CBC.. so no Britney.. I swear!!)</li>
	<li>You set the alarm time to PM instead of AM.</li>
	<li>You turned the alarm off instead of hitting the snooze (brutal!)</li>
	<li>The power went out in the middle of the night for 50 hours and the 9V battery in your alarm clock ran out so it turned off.</li>
</ul> I&#8217;d love to hear that last one. But alas, it&#8217;s always &#8220;the alarm clock&#8217;s fault&#8221;.</p>
