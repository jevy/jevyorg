<p>So, I finally have all the hardware I need to work on the robots. The problem? It&#8217;s due for the end of April and I was supposed to start in the beginning of Feburary. So, since I&#8217;ve accumulated hours that I haven&#8217;t used yet, I&#8217;m having to really work my butt off for this whole month. I might have to cut my socializing down for a little while :S</p>
