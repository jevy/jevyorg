<p>Lovely! <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;They say you cannot walk before you crawl
I wonder why, I wonder why
Because everybody dreams before they fall
A wonder world and then we lose it all</pre></p>

<p>But I will dream of tomorrow Where the past will not be in my way Passion lives another day And I will dream of tomorrow Where perhaps she&#8217;ll wait for me</p>

<p>And every single heart that I have held In my hands, in my clumsy hands I fumbled them around until they fell It&#8217;s much safer ground just keeping to myself</p>

<p>But I still dream of tomorrow Where the past will not be in my way Passion lives another day And I still dream of tomorrow Where perhaps she&#8217;ll wait for me And perhaps she&#8217;ll wait for me</p>
