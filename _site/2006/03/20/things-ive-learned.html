	<li>Parking in a no stopping zone and turning your hazards on really doesn't make it any less illegal: "Please officer, no ticket.  I had my hazards on!"</li>
	<li>I can't help but to stomp on ice that is _just_ ready to crack.  I feel like I am helping nature somehow.</li>
	<li>While on the bus, people will hate you if you're standing between them and an empty seat.</li>
	<li>Organizing your music on your computer is an endless task and will never be complete, so be happy with what you've got.</li>
	<li>The Carleton Student Engineering Society (<a href='http://www.cses.carleton.ca/'>CSES</a>) just plain stupid.  Here's an email I got this afternoon: "CSES Announcement: REMINDER - Get Involved 2006-2007. Have you applied for a CSES directorship yet?" err.. that's a VP position.</li>
	<li>Taxes <a href='http://www.quicktaxweb.ca'>online</a> are fun, fast and cheap (and if you're a student: really cheap!).  Got my refund in 8 business days.  Yay Canada!</li>
	<li>Digital Signal Processing is probably one of the coolest (err) classes I've taken yet.  I hope I do well.</li>
	<li>Tense situations can almost always be defused by honest, calm and non-critical communication.</li>
	<li>Public Transit will always be more interesting than any car.</li>
	<li>I need to proof read everything I write.  While rereading this post, I found 5 errors.  There's probably still more!</li>
