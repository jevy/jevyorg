<p>I absolutely love Kathleen Edwards - Mercury. It draws me out of life to paint a picture of the old days. The days of late evenings of doing nothing until early in the mornings. When bikes were the only form transportation. Now things are so much more compilcated. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m just bored sitting in the basement programming and resting on the couch that I&#8217;d like to live good memories and not look to the future to expect times just as good or better.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never smoked drugs but we sat around enough that I can relate: <blockquote>Wanna go get high?
Mercury is parked outside
Wanna take me to
The parking lot of the old high school
-- Kathleen Edwards - Mercury</blockquote></p>
