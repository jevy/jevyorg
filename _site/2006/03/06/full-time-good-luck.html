<p>I can&#8217;t imagine working 9-5. I&#8217;ve got four &#8220;8:30s&#8221; this week and finish at 5:30 for two of them. Now that I&#8217;m writting it down, it doesn&#8217;t sound as bad as maybe what I&#8217;m making it out to be. Anyways, it&#8217;s ruining me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in trouble once my &#8220;real&#8221; job starts this summer. 100% props to those nine to fivers out there</p>
