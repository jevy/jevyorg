<p>Hey gang! I am really excited for the new government as I&#8217;m sure many are. The Conservative minority is dandy. It will give them an opportunity to really work hard and (hopefully) build up trust in the government. It&#8217;s also nice to hear that the Liberals will be getting new leadership. I just wanted to post about some really interesting seats, the results and a thought or two: <ul>
	<li><a href='http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/riding/170/'>Ottawa - Orleans (Con)</a>.  (My house riding).  Finally a conservative!  Close-ish vote by 2%.  I was pretty surprised by this as Orleans is heavily government workers.  That does include however, plenty of military officers which I'm sure made all the difference.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/riding/110/'>Ancaster-Dundas-Flamborough-Westdale (Con)</a> - CBC was questioning Harper why they'd let a Christian run in his party.  How offensive!  David Sweet has spoken at my church and has a long track record of community and leadership experience.  I guess they felt they could trust someone who admitted God knew everything he did and will have to give account for that?  I dunno but I think that's pretty cool.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/riding/160/'>New Market - Aurora (Lib)</a> - Betcha wish you never switched eh Belinda?  Just kidding, I honestly think that Liberals are a better fit for her anyways.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/riding/060/'>Jonqui√®re-Alma (Conv)</a> - Holy crap!  A Bloc stronghold since '93 and is my dad's home riding.  He was totally blown away when I told him as he was heading to work this morning.  My Grandmaman is a hardcore liberal but I think that's all changed.  They only got 3% of the vote!  I wonder why they didn't vote for the Bloc!  Weird.</li>
</ul> Pretty sure I was seeing some more interesting ones while reading the National Post in Real Time Systems this morning.</p>
