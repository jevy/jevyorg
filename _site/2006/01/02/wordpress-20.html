<p>Just upgraded my website to Wordpress 2.0. Wow, are these guys ever quick.ï¿½ Very nicely laid out and tons of new features. Had to install a new <a href='http://ebroder.net/?page_id=72'>Livejournal Crossposting</a> plugin that should be working (that is, if you&#8217;re reading this on LJ ha).</p>

<p>In other news, the One Year Bible started today. I got the website setup last week at <a href='http://oyb.jevy.org'>oyb.jevy.org</a> (I was too cheap to buy a new domain). It&#8217;s not to late to join in and read the bible in a year! 15 minutes a day. Really! So come on out and particiate in some chat about what we&#8217;ve all read.</p>
