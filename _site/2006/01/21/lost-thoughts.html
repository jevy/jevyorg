<p>I find it so interesting how I see characteristics of myself (good and bad) in so many of these characters. Maybe that&#8217;s why I like this show so much.</p>

<p>Jack&#8217;s being a doink and he we from this heroic character to a &#8220;here we go again&#8221; guy who always makes stupid moves&#8230; and then we find out why. There&#8217;s a deeper issue to everyone no?</p>

<p>.. don&#8217;t get into this show if you haven&#8217;t already for two reasons: <ol>
	<li>It will take you 26+ hours to get into the game</li>
	<li>It will ruin your life in the process :D</li>
</ol> Cheers!</p>
