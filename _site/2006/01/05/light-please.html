<p>Started classes today and I feel fresh. It&#8217;s a new everything really. New year, new semester, summer is hopefully going to rock and I have great friends! I&#8217;m not really sure how much to ask for really. I&#8217;ve been praying and reading a lot lately and have been enjoying it.</p>

<p>Perhaps life isn&#8217;t as complex as sometimes it&#8217;s made out to be (or how I make it) and it&#8217;s supposed to simply be leaning on God for leading and that&#8217;s it. So, maybe it&#8217;s time to pick myself up and keep on truckin&#8217;. Speaking of which&#8230; anyone up for a beer tonight?</p>
