<p>I need to be clear from my <a href='http://jevy.org/2006/01/28/based-on-a-true-story/'>last post</a> as I think I caused some <a href='http://jmaltais36.livejournal.com/357776.html'>confusion</a>. I think me trying to explain myself by using more words just gets me lost. So I&#8217;ll try something different. <ul>
	<li>War = Really bad</li>
	<li>What I saw in Narnia was that the characters had a clear purpose for themselves, I would also like to have a clear purpose.</li>
	<li>In this search, I am realizing that God has designed each of us to have a purpose from God.</li>
</ul> I think that was all I was trying to say. Hopefully that makes a bit more sense.</p>
