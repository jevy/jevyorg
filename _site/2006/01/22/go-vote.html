<p>I&#8217;ll be workin&#8217; poll 103 for electoral district 35062. The only reason I know that is I had to fill out about 20 forms/envelopes for tomorrow&#8217;s vote. Should be an interesting day. The lady I&#8217;ll be working with is pretty funny: &#8220;Can I call you BUDDY?&#8221; &#8220;haha.. sure thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been following the campaigns at the federal level between the Tories, Liberals, NDP and Bloc. Before the campaign, I&#8217;m sure everyone thought it was going to end up the same as it did before the vote was called. Although it really looks like it may not at all!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sick of how people think I&#8217;m a jerk or somehow intolerant if I&#8217;m voting conservative. Worse even is that people think I&#8217;m voting for them because I am Christian therefore my vote MUST go towards a certain party: &#8220;what&#8217;s wrong with you? You&#8217;re voting for PC? Harper&#8217;s the scariest man alive! It&#8217;s because you&#8217;re Christian isn&#8217;t it. You want to end up like the States? What are you doing?&#8221;. Come on guys, I am making a free vote based on my own convictions and I&#8217;m pretty sure other Christians are doing the same.</p>
