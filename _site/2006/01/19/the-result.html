<p>Okay.. so.. I think I&#8217;ve really been hyping the readers up for &#8220;the post&#8221; or &#8220;some huge revelation about life&#8221;. Maybe I&#8217;m mildy insecure of losing readers due to my lack of interesting posts. So maybe stringing everyone will keep them coming. So I&#8217;ll wrap it up the best I can.</p>

<p>Went to a conference from Thursday to Saturday on how to hear God speak. It was really eye openning. So he&#8217;s encouraging us to pray for dreams from God and that we would have encouraging words for others. The weird thing is, I&#8217;ve been able to have a &#8220;word&#8221; or two for people and them saying it was right on! Nutsa!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m thinking a lot about long term these days. Starting with the summer, talking to profs about jobs and final projects for next summer and even considering after in graduate. That&#8217;s more than a year away!! I should try to relax and take the advice from the course I just took and listen for what God wants. I mean, he has a much better view of the playing field than any of us eh? ;)</p>
