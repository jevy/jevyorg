<p>This movie makes me wish I was at war. Not that I&#8217;d enjoy seeing people die but for the reason of having a very tangeble view of what I am living for. For example, during WWII, the world had a purpose to destroy and push back the Nazis. Today what is the purpose being thrown at us? Find a good job, get money, get a nice computer, play some video games, have a nice family, retire, sit on a beach somewhere then die. Is this not how life is &#8220;supposed&#8221; to look for us?</p>

<p>From the perspective of the bible, we are in fact at war. God has a plan for me (and for everyone reading this too!) and desires for us to step into it. Is it more worthwhile than retiring sipping margaritas on a sunny beach? Well, Christ when he came said this: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-26480&quot; class=&quot;sup&quot; /&gt;I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. He will come in and go out, and find pasture. &lt;span id=&quot;en-NIV-26481&quot; class=&quot;sup&quot; /&gt;The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.</pre></p>

<p>&#8211; <a href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2010:9-10;&version=31;'>Matthew 10:9-10</a>&lt;/blockquote&gt; So what does that practically look like for you? Well, I don&#8217;t know. I do know that God created you and so I&#8217;m sure he knows how that you can have life to the full. Mind you, he&#8217;s not our suger daddy per se but he does want a relationship. I hope you guys don&#8217;t find this cheesy over over spiritual. I just think it makes sense.</p>

<p>Update: Hopefully all cleared up <a href='http://jevy.org/2006/01/30/crazy-war-lover/'>here</a>.</p>
