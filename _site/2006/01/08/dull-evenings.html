<p>I&#8217;m not a fan of a) being bored and b) the same &#8216;ol stuff. I came to this realization not too long ago trying to plan an evening with a bunch of people who really weren&#8217;t interested (that day) to expend some energy and do some great stuff. (Sidenote: I was recruiting to skate the whole canal on the first day it was open, then go out for desert and jazz once we got to the end. Common!). Anyways, so I got mopey around the house and decided maybe I should just rent a movie. I then realized how stupid that was since I would have been the one not putting in the effort.</p>

<p>Anyways, turned out we went to a friends&#8217; place. Sat on a freezer in a kitchen, got poked for the duration, ate baked goods as they were coming out of the oven, played Starcraft (I really suck), and split a pitcher with a good buddy and got home way to late!</p>

<p>Had a blast&#8230; maybe the less organized times are the better ones? Nah&#8230;</p>

<p>I really can&#8217;t complain though. I got semi-rebuked by a pastor last year. &#8220;Some people would kill for two people they could call good friends&#8221;. Shoot. Have a great week folks!</p>
