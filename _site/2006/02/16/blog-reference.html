<p>I played squash with my long time from from first year Mr. Brian Darvell. I knew full well thatme playing against a dude who frequents the squash courts and runs 5kms three times a week would be a terrible sight (as I haven&#8217;t done much physical activity since August I&#8217;m sure). I don&#8217;t expect many people to know this guy but he&#8217;s got a pretty swell website. Brian: <ul>
	<li>.. has taught himself Jazz piano</li>
	<li>.. reads tons (or so his website suggests)</li>
	<li>.. cites his web site posts with the IEEE standard</li>
	<li>.. was in my ALSS (Applied Language for Engineers) class.</li>
	<li>.. has notes about <a href='http://darvell.ca/Articles/Finite%20Element%20Methods%20-%20Notes.pdf' target='_blank'>The Fundamentals of Finite Element Analysis</a> on his website</li>
	<li>.. is a long time jevy.org fan (or so he says ha).</li>
</ul> Anyways.. check out <a href='http://darvell.ca/'>his site</a>! Interesting stuff.</p>
