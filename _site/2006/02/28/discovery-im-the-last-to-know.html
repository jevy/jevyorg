<p>Found this CD in the car as I was driving home on Friday. I&#8217;m sure my brother buys new CDs on nearly a daily basis (which is good for me). Check <a href='http://www.newmusiccanada.com/genres/artist.cfm?Band_Id=12926'>them</a> out, in particular &#8220;Plates and Saucers&#8221;. I wish they put up &#8220;Books&#8221; but it&#8217;s not there, out well. Quality Ottawa music.</p>
