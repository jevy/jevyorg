	<li>Sometimes I feel like the dumbest person ever.  This mainly when I can't figure out assignments/labs and I seem to be the only one who doesn't get it.  Thinking about it, this probably isn't true.</li>
	<li>I generally think that people don't need chiropractors.  But tonight he cracked my neck.. like... well, I dunno.. but it was great stuff.  It was a year and a half since I was there last.</li>
	<li>The chiropractor told me to enjoy the rest of my school as it's supposedly the best years of my life.  I refuse to believe this as I'm sure it will keep getting better and better as I mature and grow in my relationship with the God who knows me best.</li>
	<li>I have done zero planning for NYC.  It looks like it will be Friday mornings work.  The plane leaves at 2:30pm.  All we have so far is "the Producers" for $46!!  SICCCKKKKKKKKK.  Probably will try to get Rush tickets for a bunch of others.</li>
	<li>Google Talk via Gmail is killer.</li>
