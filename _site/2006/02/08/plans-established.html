<p>That&#8217;s it then. I got a call last night for a job position in the city and I have taken them up on it. In a brief moment my hopes for spending another summer in Europe were dashed. I am trusting that this is what I&#8217;m supposed to do this summer. It&#8217;s going to be a pretty sweet job I&#8217;m sure. That summer I had an absolute blast with the people who were here. My heart wants to &#8220;re-create&#8221; that experience but I realize that will just be setting myself up for dissapointment. Instead, I look forward to new summer filled with roadtrips, new adventures and lots of Ultimate. Wh00p wh00p</p>

<p>Oh yeah.. and NYC for a couple of days of &#8220;Reading Week&#8221;</p>
