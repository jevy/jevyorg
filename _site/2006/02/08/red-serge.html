<p>I just found out that my dad will be guarding the singer at the Sens-Rangers game tonight. It&#8217;s to promote Canadian tourism or something. Anyways, if anyone&#8217;s interested, it&#8217;s covered by TSN. I told him to get pictures with Alfie and I think it&#8217;s funny that the Rangers want to have pictures with HIM! haha</p>
