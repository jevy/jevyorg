<p>So I didn&#8217;t end up blogging as much as I thought I would while I was there. I think we&#8217;re better off. I posted all my pics on my (new) photo gallery. I&#8217;ll be cleaning up that gallery soon. Anyways. Check it out <a href='http://jevy.org/photos/v/nyc2k6/'>here</a>!</p>

<p>It was a blast of a trip. Hostel was great (except for the showers). Saw &#8220;The Producers&#8221;, hit up MoMa, ate TONS, spent enough, walking dead streets in the middle of the night, checked some of the &#8221;<a href='http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4245337360492479670&q=lazy+sunday'>Lazy Sunday</a>&#8221; landmarks, ate more, hung out with CRU friends from Queens&#8230; and more!</p>
