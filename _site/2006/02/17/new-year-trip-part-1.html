<p>Got to the airport nice and early at 11:30am to get on my plane for 2pm (hummm 13 minutes ago). Flight cancelled. Not surprising the <a href='http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/02/17/weather060217.html'>state of Ottawa right now</a>. Sat on the line at a payphone in our bright shiny new airport for 45 minutes listening to the same music over.. and over.. and over. Every 10 minutes the lady would come on: &#8220;Sorry Mr. Malt-eh-iz but it&#8217;s really taking awhile for the new reservation to go through&#8221;. I really didn&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m flying out tonight at 7pm through Washington then to NYC. More time to sit around.</p>
<strong>Lesson #1:</strong>
<p>Canada&#8217;s beating the US in the olympics, making me very happy to be going to the States right now :)</p>
