<p>This is <a href='http://uk.tickle.com/test/inkblot/start.html'>one sweet test</a>! I&#8217;m trying not to put too much weight on it but it got some points bang on. <img class='alignright' src='http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/curiosity.thumbnail.jpg' id='image249' height='96' alt='Curiosity' width='96' />You are full of questions about life, people, and your own potential. You spend more time than others imagining the possibilities for your life â€“ and you&#8217;re open to things others are too afraid to consider. You have an almost physical need to know and do more. It&#8217;s only through new experiences that you feel a greater understanding of yourself and the world. You also have a rebellious streak that shows up when you feel unable to truly influence the world or circumstances around you. Your appetite for novel experiences also shows an openness others don&#8217;t have, but wish they did. Your psyche is very rich; the more you learn about it, the more you will understand who you really are.</p>
