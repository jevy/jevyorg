<p>So Jack&#8217;s Mannequin got to me. In high school I made a CD every month to put play in the Escort with my killer sound system. Since, I haven&#8217;t really made those types of musical collections since and it is something I miss, I was thinking I could trade with people. How about it, if you make me a mix tape (compile as an ISO?), I&#8217;ll send you one. How does that sound?</p>
