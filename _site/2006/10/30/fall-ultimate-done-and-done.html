<p>Well, many of the fields are offline for the rest for the last game of the season so that&#8217;s it for the Ultimaniacs Fall 2006. We&#8217;re getting together to chill at Lone Star later tonight to say &#8220;adieu&#8221; for now. We finished in last place with 2 wins 8 losses ouch. Mind you the fall league usually attracts the best players and the last four teams were within one game of each other. I&#8217;m trying not to take it personally :P</p>

<p>I&#8217;m debating on winter league now though&#8230; hummm</p>
