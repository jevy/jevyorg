<p>Okay. So facebook is much more cultish than before. The problem? I love it. Initially it sucked because there wasn&#8217;t anything to do other than like post your profile. So after you found all your &#8220;long lost friends&#8221; and sending one (or maybe two) &#8220;we haven&#8217;t spoken in four years. Sup?&#8221; type of messages it was over.</p>

<p>Now however people are posting videos and pictures like no tomorrow! So much fun! It&#8217;s almost like blogging for idiots. So for all those people who I know who don&#8217;t have a blog, they&#8217;re on facebook. It&#8217;s so much easier to keep up with people.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m outs for now guys, I need to go add more &#8220;friends&#8221; to validate myself as a human being. I HAVE INTERNET FRIENDS. W00t!</p>
