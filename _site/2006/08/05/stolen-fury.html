<p>Plumb named her kid Solomon Fury Lee. I have never heard such a powerful name and I feel as though she stole the name of my (future) kid. Despite her thinking of it first.</p>

<p>Just checked out her website and there is a MAD MAD MAD danceable version of &#8220;cut&#8221; on her site. <a href='http://www.plumbinfo.com'>GO NOW</a> AND TURN IT UP LOUD LOUD LOUD. It&#8217;s got me going and it&#8217;s only freakin&#8217; 10:38am in the morning!! HAZAAAHHHHHHHH</p>
