<p>It&#8217;s true! You don&#8217;t need to be a hooched up, good looking woman either! Twice this summer I&#8217;ve been working my charm on the waitresses. So much so that they spill water all over me then give me free stuff. It&#8217;s easy, watch: <ol>
	<li>It was late June after an ultimate game. We went out to the Barley Mow in Barrhaven (we were playing way out there) to grab some beer and food. As the waitress was coming around behind me, she tripped on my chair, spilling a water all down my back. Everywhere! Now, I didn't particularly care as it makes a decent story and a good laugh for the team. She apologized profusely and quickly offered up a free desert. Score!</li>
	<li>Last night we went out to meet James' girlfriend (I was there for the cheap wings. Let's me honest). I ordered a water to go with my wings. The waitress was coming towards us from the other side of the table. As she pulled the pitcher of Ricard's off, she forgot there was still a water on the tray so she didn't keep the tray on balance. Consequently, I watched (in slow motion) as a full glass of water (was there a lemon?) landed square on the table, and in the process drenching my jeans. I had to shake my head and laugh as the waitress said things like: "I'm so glad you didn't yell and me" and "I _swear_ I've never done anything like this before". She asked "I'm so sorry, can I get you a free drink or something? Anything". My pants felt that much drier just then as I politely asked for a bottle of Stella. We had much better service for the rest of the night.</li>
</ol> <strong>Update:</strong> The moral of the story is always look for the clumsiest waitresses.</p>
