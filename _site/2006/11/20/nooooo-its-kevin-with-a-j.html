<p>Since Facebook is really picking up, I decided to see how many people with the name &#8220;Jevin&#8221; were on there. Turns out there&#8217;s a bunch of us. So naturaly, last night I started a facebook support group and invited all the Jevin&#8217;s. By tonight? 21 people have joined the group &#8220;Nooooo&#8230; It&#8217;s Kevin with a J&#8221;. The coolest thing? They&#8217;re from all different cultures!! Brown, Black, Latino and White (I&#8217;m sure some Asians will pop by soon). Here are some of the comments on the discussion board: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Jevin 1: &quot;I thought I was the only one with this name. XD&quot;</pre></p>

<p>Jevin 4: &#8220;I have waited so long for some one to share my pain of having to say &#8220;its kevin with a J&#8221; damn how hard is it to say jevin&#8221;</p>

<p>Jevin 5: &#8220;Our names confuse people with 1 simple letter&#8230; bahahaha&#8221;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
