	<li>Checked out the 30th anniversary celebration service at my friend's church.  The best part?  I understood _nothing_!  It was all in Spanish.  ha!  Knowing french, it's not too hard to pick up on similar words and put it all together to get the gist of things.</li>
	<li>Hit up this sweet lounge called Vinyl on Friday night.  They were playing some weird hip-hop initially then moved to some sweet mashups of old songs with new beats (think a remixed Dance Mix '93) then to good 'ol house music.  Then it got really crowded so it was time to head out.</li>
	<li>Managed not to get sick despite a bunch of us were.</li>
	<li>Bought some pants?  That's good but I'm not sure if it's blog worthy.</li>
	<li>Didn't use my camera enough.</li>
