<p>Never noticed this before but it looks like Adobe is working on a competitor for Apple&#8217;s Aperture. It&#8217;s mainly designed for workflow stuff. So, if you&#8217;re someone that stakes stacks of photos of pictures at an event but feel it&#8217;s too tedious to sort through all the pictures a delete all the crappy ones (ie the vast majority), play with this program.</p>

<p>Oh yeah&#8230;. it&#8217;s free for now. <a href='http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/lightroom/'>Adobe Lightroom</a>.</p>
