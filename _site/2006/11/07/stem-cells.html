<p>I went with my parents to get a semi-private tour of the brand new <a href='http://www.ohri.ca/centres/StemCellResearch/default.asp'>Stem cell research centre</a> in the<a href='http://www.ohri.ca'> Ottawa Hospital Research Institute</a> (OHRI) today. <a href='http://www.ohri.ca/profiles/rudnicki.asp'>Dr. Rudnicki</a> himself was giving us the tour and answering questions. One of the highlights was to hang out with some of those on the tour. <a href='http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/166/10/1327-a'>Dr. John Dossetor</a> was one of the seven of us along for the tour. Once you got talking to him turns out he was the very first person to perform a live kidney transplant in Canada. Doing more research he is one of the Canadian forerunners in the area of bioethics. What a privledge!</p>

<p>The work done here in the city is quite groundbreaking and exciting. I still don&#8217;t really understand any of what is going on but the examples given really opened your eyes as to what can be done. Someone asked about the ethical ramifications of this research. Currently, all the work done at the OHRI is with stem cells that are lying dormant or not very active. They are working on getting them to do things like actively repair damaged tissue etc. Cool! When asked about embryotic work, they don&#8217;t do any right now but likely will in the future.</p>

<p>So what does this mean for me? How do I respond to this whole can of worms about pre-engineering my baby to not have any diseases or not to have my corn allergy to allow Jevy Jr. to eat popcorn every night. Where should the line be drawn? Looks like I have some researching and praying to do. Thoughts?</p>
