<p>Anyways, I wanted to post about how I keep my email organized.</p>
<strong>Background</strong><strong>What I used to do</strong><strong>Now</strong>
<p>All in all, if you aren&#8217;t using gmail, well&#8230; go get it.. if you are.. try this archiving thing. If you&#8217;re really ambicious, try turning on the keyboard shortcuts, it <em>really</em> speeds things up. Like &#8220;y&#8221; to archive this message.</p>
