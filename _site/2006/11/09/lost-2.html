<p>Yesterday the semi-season finale. I cannot get over how crazy this show is. It&#8217;s frustrating how they designed it to be addictive where you simply cannot guess anything right. Why do I like it so much despite this? Good stinking question. If you don&#8217;t keep up with the show &#8211; don&#8217;t start. You need to watch <em>every episode</em> to know what the crap is going on.</p>

<p>Very very well done show though if you have days on end to catch up. Mind you, it&#8217;s only back in February.</p>
