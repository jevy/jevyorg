<p>I just found out that my website looks like poo poo in internet explorer (use Firefox peoples!). This website actually causes me frustration. Like what the heck? I try to fix it up but I don&#8217;t enjoy it. Maybe I just want it to look pro because I feel it should be. Maybe because it&#8217;s something that I can show off to people but the problem is, I&#8217;m far from satisfied with how it looks. I&#8217;m not sure why, but I&#8217;m actually stressed about it. Man! What the heck? Oh well, I just need to tell myself it&#8217;s really not that big of a deal if I can&#8217;t have a nice website even if all I want is something simple.</p>
