I went for a walk this evening just to clear my head and to get some fresh air.  I walked along the edge of the park when I seldomly walk when the memories came rushing in.

.. they were beautiful ..

.. grades 1-6 don't seem so long ago as I can remember them like they just happend.  I feel like I should be doing more with them, like actively enjoying them or reminising with other people about them.  Somehow it seems like I'm the only that cares about the memories and I wonder why.  Maybe I just have a hard time letting go.

One house in particular had their garbage out two days in advance.  They were through out all kinds of kids stuff like hockey helmets and doll houses.  I'm not purposely trying to be sentimental but wouldn't people want to keep this stuff to just enjoy looking at it?  I don't even know what to do with memories.  I suppose just let them sit on the shelf and make sure that they're not completely forgotten for that day when you're old and dying.
