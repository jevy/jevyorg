Went out to Clocktower for beer and wings tonight.  (They upped the prices for wings and beer sinec the last time I was there :P).  Anyways, hearing stories about people and their experiences in East Asia (can't say the name but it's a large closed country) and Tanzania.  It's cool that people are really excited to hear about Jesus Christ over there.

It makes me wonder my own calling.  People are talking about spending a year in some of these places.  I'm really excited for them but I have some real spiritual conflicts with Campus Crusade that just don't work with my personality and my understanding of how God has shown how He's worked in my life.  Now that will sound strange to those who don't really know much about Christian culture or Christian organizations but basically what I'm saying is that I don't feel that I could operate in this organization long term.  I would choke.

I'm excited to find out in the next couple of years what God has in store for me longer term.  G'night y'all.
