How do you deal with being interested in so much stuff?  There are so many cool things that I could immerse all my time into.  Bahh!  There's so much that I just want to sleep.  So are more recent or just short lived to name a few.
<ul>
	<li>Ultimate</li>
	<li>Guitar</li>
	<li>Whitewater Kayaking</li>
	<li>Video Games</li>
	<li>Studying the bible</li>
	<li>Amateur Radio</li>
	<li>Photography</li>
</ul>

blah blah blah
