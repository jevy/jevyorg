"Holy crap?  Is it 8am?"

So, today I set my alarm to 8am in the hopes that I could try to get to work a bit later (and get more sleep).  So anyways, the alarm goes off.  I get through the shower and breakfast, catch the early bus and get to work.

I check my computer: 8am?  What the heck?  That's earlier than I get here normally!!!  I guess that I either: a) never had my alarm set properly in the first place or b) it never went off, I just looked at the clock and autopilot kicked in for the morning routine.  So really, that bus wasn't early at all, it was right on time.  Come to think of it, it was seeing the 7:35am regulars at 8:35am too.  "Wow!  Maybe other people are trying to sleep in too!  What smart people!" Wow

<strong>UPDATE</strong>:  Well, turns out somehow I set my clock's time an hour forward so it said 8am when it was really 7am.  BOOOOOO.
