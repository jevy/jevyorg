Don't ask me how I came across this site but it's great.  It's this chubby breakdancer that goes around to various demonstrations and talks to the people about their issues from a conservative standpoint.  It's pretty funny and usually ends up pop 'n locking for them.  For sure worth checking out: <a href="http://www.popandlock.com">popandlock.com</a> with Rippin' Richie.
