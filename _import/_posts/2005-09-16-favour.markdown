So I get a call on my cell while sitting in the Chaplaincy during lunch yesterday from my supervisor during the summer:
<blockquote>Warren: Hi Jevin!  Communications Carleton and the Dean are coming in a noon to do a photoshoot with your robots and it would be great if you could make it.
Jevin: Uhhh... I wasn't planning on coming in, it's sorta my day off.
Warren:  I'd really, really appreciate it.
Jevin:  Uhh... sure!  No problem!  See you at noon.
Warren:  Thanks for being flexible.  See you then</blockquote>

So on the way to his office today I saw my <a href="http://www.carleton.ca/cuuc/courses/SYSC/4505.html">Automatic Control Systems</a> professor in the hall so I waved and said "hi professor".  He stopped, looked at me:
<blockquote>"Where do I know you from?"
Me: "I'm in your automatic control class"
Prof. S: "You're that guy in that video!!!"
Me: "Pardon?"
Prof S: "The robot video where it runs after stuff!"
Me: "Oh!  haha.  Yeah I guess I am" (fully wondering what the heck else he saw on my personal blog)</blockquote>

Anyways so the photo shoot was interesting.  I didn't really think I was nervous but my hands were leaving those heat marks on the table.  You know what I mean?  Anyways, I blame it on the heat and humidity.... even though it was 17 degrees out today :D
