title: The Thankful Hippie

I've been trying to focus on being more grateful for things in my life.  There always seems to be something wrong and I am finding it's really easy to become focussed on that problem.  I decided a few weeks back that I would focus on the good in life and the things that are going well!  What a difference!  Being thankful for a job, for a warm (and cozy) bed, some great friends, for a relationship with my Maker, for the food I eat.  This list really does go on.

Sometimes though, we all get to a point where we feel we're getting the short end of the stick.  What then?  Well.. at least I have breath.

So anyways, it seems that this being thankful thing is making me more conscience about the world around me.  From relationships, to the environment.  I'm finding I am becoming more environmentally conscience, organic food aware and more easy going.  It's really weird!
