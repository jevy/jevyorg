So week three of my yeast/wheat/flour/corn/milk/MSG/<strong>sugar</strong> candida killin' diet.  It's going fairly well but it's stressful trying to find supplements for all the regular foods that I normally eat.  I'm allowed certain types of unprocessed sugar (maple syrup and honey) because our bodies process it differently than processed sugars.  Here are some of my things I've had to change:

<a title="image00001.jpg" onclick="doPopup(394);return false;" class="imagelink" href="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/image00001.jpg"><img width="128" height="96" alt="image00001.jpg" id="image394" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/image00001.jpg" /></a>Veggie Protein wow.  I guess socially concerned/vegan body builders weren't exactly the stereotype I had it mind.  Anyways, I am now drinking at least one shake a day.  Soy milk, protein and various berries all shook up.  I think I'm addicted.

<a title="Rice Cakes" onclick="doPopup(395);return false;" class="imagelink" href="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/image00002.jpg"><img width="72" height="96" alt="Rice Cakes" id="image395" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/image00002.thumbnail.jpg" /></a>Rice cakes.  ie. not flour based.  Therefore, good.

<a title="Vegenaise" onclick="doPopup(396);return false;" class="imagelink" href="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/image00003.jpg"><img width="128" height="96" alt="Vegenaise" id="image396" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/image00003.thumbnail.jpg" /></a>Vegenaise.  I am an absolute mayo nut.  Since it's egg based, vegans won't eat regular mayonase.  This one happens not to contain any sugar so that's why it works for me.  Actually tastes pretty good!

<a title="Tofu Poo" onclick="doPopup(398);return false;" class="imagelink" href="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/image00004.jpg"><img width="127" height="96" alt="Tofu Poo" id="image398" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/image00004.thumbnail.jpg" /></a>Yuck yuck yuck.  I got my dad to taste this peanut butter (tofu based) before I gave it a shot.  "Tastes like brown dry wall".  Actually, he wasn't far off.  I just pile on the honey.

<a title="Yumm" onclick="doPopup(399);return false;" class="imagelink" href="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/image00005.jpg"><img width="128" height="96" alt="Yumm" id="image399" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/image00005.thumbnail.jpg" /></a>But for now folks.  I'm going to enjoy my rasberry smoothie.  Eat that Booster Juice!!
