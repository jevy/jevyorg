I love my city, I really do.  I've always tried to get out of the suburbs into the city and find things that this city has to offer.  Ever since high school I've always heard people say how boring Ottawa is compared to Toronto or Montreal.  While it's true they are bigger cities with more going on, Ottawa has tons of interesting stuff going on!  As with anything, it just takes time and energy to find those things.

Here are some of my favorite links for living in the city of Ottawa.  Maybe there's more?  If so let me know.

Restaurant reviews and discussions:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://restaurantthing.com/ca/on/ottawa/index.php">Restaurantthing.com</a> - Used this for years.  There are fights in the reviews between competing ethic food restaurants.  It's quite entertaining.  Don't trust all the reviews but it's a good reference.</li>
<li><a href="http://ottawafoodies.com/">Ottawafoodies.com</a> - Interesting local site.  There's a <a href="http://wiki.ottawafoodies.com/doku.php?id=events">wiki</a> with events.  I never would have heard of this stuff otherwise.</a>
</ul>

Events:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ottawaevents.org/">Ottawaevents.org</a> - Ghetto looking site with great updates.  They put lots of effort to find the right stuff.  I get their RSS feed so I get all the latest and greatest.</li>
<li><a href="http://attractionsontario.ca/">Attractionsontario.ca</a> - If you're willing to travel the province a bit, this new site might have some ideas for you.
P.S.  I'm writing this on the train coming back from Montreal.  Cool!</li>
</ul>

I might think of more later and will then make this a stand-alone page.
