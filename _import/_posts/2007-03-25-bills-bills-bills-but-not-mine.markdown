Over the next couple of days, I'll be going up to Parliament hill with an organization called "<a href="http://4mycanada.ca">4MyCanada</a>" meeting with MPs and sharing our heart for this country.  Anyways, so I'm just spending some time researching what's going on in the House of Commons.  Man!  Is it ever interesting.  The <a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca">Parliament of Canada</a>'s website makes things very accessible.  Take finding the recent bills in the House of Commons for example: You can see <a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HouseBills/BillsGovernment.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1">all the bills</a> before the house and the <a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=status&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1">recent news</a> about each!

Anyways.. an interesting way to spend part of a Sunday afternoon.
