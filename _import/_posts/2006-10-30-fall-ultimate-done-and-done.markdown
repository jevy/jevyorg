Well, many of the fields are offline for the rest for the last game of the season so that's it for the Ultimaniacs Fall 2006.  We're getting together to chill at Lone Star later tonight to say "adieu" for now.  We finished in  last place with 2 wins 8 losses ouch.  Mind you the fall league usually attracts the best players and the last four teams were within one game of each other.  I'm trying not to take it personally :P

I'm debating on winter league now though... hummm
