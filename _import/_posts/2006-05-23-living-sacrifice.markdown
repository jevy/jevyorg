It's 100% <a href="http://www.ocua.ca">Ultimate </a>season and I absolutely love it.  Everything!  The effort, sweat, my team (one dude LOVES <a href="http://www.di.fm/trance/">Trance</a>!!), the beer afterwards and being the baby of the team.  My back is shot for some reason but I now remember the importance of stretching (thanks gym teachers from elementary school!).  I'll maybe take some pictures next week.  We're won our two first games, 15-9 then 11-8 tonight.  Granted for those last couple of points, the other team was down a player but hey.

Anyways, it's going to be a great season I'm sure if people stick around.
