I'm in my ritual lab at school after finishing a lab early.  Can I feed your stereotype of engineers?
* The guy diagonally to my left is reading <a href="http://slashdot.org">slashdot</a> and looking at screen shots from video games.
* Two guys are talking about his cell phone.
* The guy to my right is reading a newspaper in Chinese.
* Then there's a bunch of us studying notes online.
