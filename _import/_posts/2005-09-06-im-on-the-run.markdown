	<li>School hasn't even started yet and things are getting really busy.  IEEEEEE
</li>

	<li>On Saturday, <a href="http://users.livejournal.com/users/fios">Jay P</a> and I went to the OARC's <a href="http://oarc.net/fleamarket/index.html">Hamfest</a>.  I'll admit it was hardcore geeky in that we were more than likely the youngest licensed hams out of probably a good 200 people.  Now that shows you how old the average age of the people in this hobby is.</li>
	<li>My pastor stepped down from his leadership position on Friday night.  I feel sorta lost as we probably won't see him until he figures out what he's going to do next.  Please pray for me and my church family.  I'm confident that the timing of this is all God's doing and that He will really step things up so that we can fulfill the vision that he has given us.  Church website <a href="http://onlc.org">here</a> for those interested.
