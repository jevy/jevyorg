Started classes today and I feel fresh.  It's a new everything really.  New year, new semester, summer is hopefully going to rock and I have great friends!  I'm not really sure how much to ask for really.  I've been praying and reading a lot lately and have been enjoying it.

Perhaps life isn't as complex as sometimes it's made out to be (or how I make it) and it's supposed to simply be leaning on God for leading and that's it.  So, maybe it's time to pick myself up and keep on truckin'.  Speaking of which... anyone up for a beer tonight?
