Things are going remarkably well these days.  I've spent nearly every weekday in the lab and just got an email from my prof saying that I have "talent".  Wow!  I don't think I've ever been called tallented in anything really before.  He's going to try to work me into a job for the Engineering department or at the very least get me an official research grant for the rest of the summer.  I really wasn't expecting any payment for this stuff (not that I have it yet but am hopeful)  but I've been praying nearly everyday that God would lead this entire summer.  Believe what you will but I'm confident he's got his hand on this situation.

The apartment's great!  Located in a really nice area local to a lot of stuff.  I would post some pics but I don't know where my usb cable for my camera is :P.
