So for tonight I think we all might as well head on down to Heart and Crown.  Kristy says Jay Colson's band will be there so that would likely be a lot of fun.  I'm thinking 9pm would be a good time to meet since we could probably still be able to snatch a table.  If people get bored, feel free to drop by my place since I'll be here until we head over there.  Just give me a shot to let me know you're coming over.  236-7341.  I live at 234C Russell Ave.

See y'all there
