Well, I did it.  I've been at my beloved church Newlife, for over five years now.  I feel that God is telling me it's time to head out, out into the land of the unknown.  Partly, I need to find a place with some people my own age who I can relate to.  There are other reasons but that is one of the main ones.  So I called up someone on the leadership team and put my heart out on the table (over the phone?).  He said it'd be sad not to see me there which is mutual for both of us for sure!  So, I feel an obligation to announce it to the congregration as they have loved me and taken me under their wing for so many years.

Where to now?  Lord knows... really!
