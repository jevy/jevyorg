I hear of people all the time graduating university and not finding jobs.  Here are tips that I've found (or been told) that I'd like to pass on to you all.  These may be centric to Engineering but they might help you.

Here are the problems:
<ol>
	<li>Most of us in university have zero experience in the degree/major that we're in.</li>
	<li>Many "starting" jobs want 2 years of industry experience before they look at you.  I mean, who wants someone who has no idea how industry works.</li>
</ol>
Some ideas:
<ul>
	<li>Professors - Probably the best resource for a) advice b) industry contacts.  Get to know your professors and their areas of interest.  Do they have expertise in the class you're taking?  Have they worked in industry in that field before?  Chances are they still have contacts or are doing contract work in industry.  How do you get at this info.  After getting to know them, ask questions about the areas you're interested in.  Ask how would you get started and companies that do that particular type of work.  Would they write a reference and hand in a resume for you?  Ask for advice.  Many are willing to help students out.</li>
	<li>Volunteer - This helped me gain the trust of a professor which in turn led to a summer job and the job I am currently working at.  Ask a professor if that have any projects you could volunteer on.  I'm sure they'd be surprised and often do have projects they would love to do but just don't have the time.  This will build your repore with them.  At the very least, you've worked on something interesting (in the area you'd like to work in), can put it on your resume and have gained the trust of a professor.</li>
	<li>Final Design Project - Do something that is directly related to a job you're interested in applying for.  8 hours a week x 24 weeks = uhh.. enough hours to say that you have experience in an area.  An example: People who worked on the <a href="http://cusp.mae.carleton.ca/">Flight Simulator project</a>, often get hired by <a href="http://www.gdcanada.com/">General Dynamics</a>.  Makes sense right?</li>
</ul>
That's all I can think of right now.  Hopefully that helps someone.
