Sometimes whoever is worship leading trys something different to try to help people get into worship.  I think this was a bit much on Sunday.  Refering to Galations 5. I could not help laughing:
<blockquote>*Reggae style*
Chorus: God's Apple is Love
His Orange Is Patience
Banana Is Self-control
His Lemon Is Peace
His Kindness A Peach
And My Life is Da Bowl</blockquote>

Mind you, I am _really_ glad I'm not in some legalistic church.  Here we have fun and enjoy God at the same time.  Soooo sweeet
