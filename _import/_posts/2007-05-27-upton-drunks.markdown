On Friday a bunch of us went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Upton">Jason Upton</a>'s concert down at Dominion Chalmers.  Man!  Probably one of the most fun concerts I've ever been to.

It started off with some of his own worship stuff which was really really great stuff.  You could really sense God inspiring him as he played.  He took a couple of minutes to address the crowd.  He started talking about creativity and arts.
<blockquote>
Jason: Any artists in the house?
*A bunch of people yelled out YEAAHHH*
Jason: Cool!
* A harmonica plays from the back of the venue *
Jason: Whoa!  What was that?  Come up here.
* Nothing happens so he keeps talking.  A raggity 'ol fellow who looks drunk comes up to the stage *
</blockquote>

At this point I'm sure most of us were thinking "oh man.. a drunk guy invited on stage?  This isn't going to end well."  Jason invites him on stage to play with him.  The guy plays a tune on the harmonica-- "you know that one?".  "Uhhh" says the band "just play it!  We'll join you".  Anyways, so the guy starts playing and the band joins him!  It was freaking sweet!  How many bands (let alone worship leaders) would take a chance and invite a drunk guy on stage?  Talk about breaking open people's "boxes".

Jason later shared his story of being born in 1973 of a 16 year old who had recently became a Christian.  She refused to have an abortion despite hard pressure.  She was in a place where she had to give him up for adoption.  Anyways turns out the family he was placed with was a Christian family and raised him really well!  Last year Jason met his mother for the first time.  The crazy thing?  She's been listening to his CDs for the past six years.  DWWHHATTTT??  So cool!
