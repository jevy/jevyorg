Casino Royale was absolutely awesome.  Saw this with a bunch of the Crusade crew.  For whatever the reason, more than half of the theatre was over the age of 60 years old.  Weird!  I was worried the lady next to me was going to have a heart attack or something since she was gasping in suspense every five minutes.

People say this movie "isn't a typical Bond movie".  True enough!  This is the first movie of the series and we see a different side of James that we never seen again: emotional involvement.  This is really what I love about it, he actually demonstrates a "real love" that he has for the "Bond girl".  In the end however, he clams right up and we never see that again-- in any other movie.  Awesome!
