I was so thrilled to be invited to our Christmas party from my job this past summer.  We were for sure the youngest table there so we made it a point to be extremely (obscenely?) loud and outgoing.  We got a team picture with the head boss, yelled for our team during the "games" and tore up the dance floor.  It was surprising to see so many government workers really let loose on the dance floor.  I won a bottle of wine as a door prize (w00t) which was a nice added bonus.  It's nice to still have really fun relationships carry over even when my time working with them is over.  Pictures to come?  Maybe.. ;D
