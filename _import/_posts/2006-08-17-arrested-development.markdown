Introduced to me by a hilarious Pakistani guy in my lab in the spring, it is probably one of my favorite shows ever (in high competition with <a href="http://jevy.org/2006/08/12/those-were-the-days/">this</a>).  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested_Development">Arrested Development</a> (AD) was canceled halfway through the third season likely since the ratings weren't so high.  Why?  Well,  I think many people simply "don't get it".  The humor is subtle with no laugh track.  It's kind of like "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office">The Office</a>" (which many people have heard of) in the sense that the humor is subtle and awkward but AD is better quality in my opinion.  So anyway, rent the first episode of the first season and you'll know in 20 minutes if you'll like it or not.  Very very good stuff.

Note: If it's not your style, that's cool.  My co-worker bought the second season and when the cashier gave the bag back to him she said "I really don't get this show".  So yeah, she's either above it, or below it.
