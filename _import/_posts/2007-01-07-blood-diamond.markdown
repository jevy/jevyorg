Leo DiCaprio had died, he shows up in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450259/">Blood Diamond</a>.  Despite being a long movie (actually, I guess it's not that long -- 143 min), I was engaged the whole movie through.  It really shows the reality of child solders in Africa, which until this movie, I really didn't know existed to that extent.  Lots of fun action and wasn't ruined by a cheesy love story.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000124/">Jenn Connelly</a> is stunning and plays her part really well.  The overall story was really quite believable which is probably why it was so easy to let yourself to be taken away by this movie.

Bonus:  My man, Morgan Freeman (another one of my fav actors) chilling with Djimon Hounsou <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/granitz/5515/Events/5515/MorganFree_Cohen_11731586_400.jpg.html?path=pgallery&path_key=Hounsou,%20Djimon">here</a>.
