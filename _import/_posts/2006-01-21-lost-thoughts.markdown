I find it so interesting how I see characteristics of myself (good and bad) in so many of these characters.  Maybe that's why I like this show so much.

Jack's being a doink and he we from this heroic character to a "here we go again" guy who always makes stupid moves... and then we find out why.  There's a deeper issue to everyone no?

.. don't get into this show if you haven't already for two reasons:
<ol>
	<li>It will take you 26+ hours to get into the game</li>
	<li>It will ruin your life in the process :D</li>
</ol>
Cheers!
