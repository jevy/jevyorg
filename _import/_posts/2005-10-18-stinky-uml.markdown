So I got home yesterday afternoon to work on my UML assignment that was due that same day.  I started work when I got this really rotten B.O. smell coming from somewhere.  I discretely check my armpits (don't know why I was trying to be discrete, I was in my room by myself) to see if that's where it was coming from.  It didn't seem like it, so I kept working.  Five minutes later it's back!  WHAT THE HECK?  So I sniff again.  Turns out it's THE TEXTBOOK!  Man, so much worry over a stickin' textbook (literally).
