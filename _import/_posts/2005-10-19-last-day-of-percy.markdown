Wow.. it's been a long week and the biggest day is still ahead.  <a href="http://iagreewithpercy.com/whoispercy.php">Percy</a> is speaking tomorrow and it's going to be off the hook for sure.  I was asked to be on a panel of four people at the evening event.  I'm anxious (not really nervous) as my bible knowledge and apologetics (proof of God and Christ etc) isn't really up to snuff.  I'm praying that I'll be useful on the panel and that the amount of projectiles hitting me in the eye will be kept to a minimum.

Seriously though, everyone should come out to one of the two times Percy's speaking.  He has an incredible story.  Systems Eng 100%!!!!!!!!
