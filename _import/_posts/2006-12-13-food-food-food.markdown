Okay, food is seriously all I can think of these days.  I eat all day long.  The thing is, the options are mega limited about what I can eat because of this whole Candida thing.  I'm seeing my naturopathic doctor tomorrow morning to see what I can re-introduce in my diet.  Anyways, I had some time tonight and wanted to try something new so I whipped together this great (and simple) <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/25360">Chickpea Curry</a>.  It's so frustrating not being able to eat what you want anymore.  My mom has always said "I wish I could eat anything I want just like you".  Well, now I guess I can understand where she's coming from.

Anyways, time to grab some of my organic chips!  Yum Yummy!
