Such a killer weekend!  Went on a two day "Intro to whitewater Kayaking" and I have to say I'm hooked.  I seriously did not want to stop.  The instructor was awesome and explained everything about why the water was doing such-and-such and what to look for etc.  It was group of four of us two of which were my dad and I.  I was initially reluctant about going since it was just him and I going since the conversation would be slow.  It really wasn't, we talked about all kinds of good stuff.

Anyways,  I still have tons of pictures to post (although I didn't get any of me getting my eskimo roll down the _first time_.  Man I'm proud of that) and I'll try to do that either tonight or tomorrow.
