I thought today was going to be uneventful..

.. then I heard "The Sign" by Ace of Bass and then I started reflecting back to grade 5.  Then a lady bug just landed on my keyboard.  What's it thinking!!

Sens vs. Tampa was awesome last night.  It's hilarious when people want a quiet _hockey_ game.  We started calling at St. Louis and this lady in front of us said "VOYON....".  So I pretended to be from Iceland as if I didn't understand that she was frustrated.  Her son sorta looked at me and rolled his eyes at his mom.  lol.  Videos posted tomorrow!!
