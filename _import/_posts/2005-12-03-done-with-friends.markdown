Well, Thursday was a particularly sad day as it was the last class that I will ever be having with my engineering friends from first year.  I'm going to be taking a fifth year, and as such, still have two third year classes to catch up on next semester. On top of that, I'm taking an engineering elective that none of my friends are opting to take (common'!!!  DSP is going to be incredible!!).  Not that I like looking too far ahead but next year could be rough not having my friends in any of my classes.  Oh well...

.. maybe time to move out next year?  :o

P.S. Funny pictures coming soon
