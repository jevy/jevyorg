So I've always had a hard time enjoying classical music and yet I have always loved scores to soundtracks of movies and shows.  I have recently discovered <a href="http://www.streamingsoundtracks.com/">StreamingSoundtracks.com</a>.  Maybe soundtracks are really emotional and yet I hear that classical music _is_ really emotional.  In any case, it's great.  Enjoy!
