Wow.  I know I'm the greatest poker player but first one out of the 15 people that played?  <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/skofz/">James</a>' party was pretty fun but it's odd when you don't really know the majority of the people.  That's really lame.  Maybe I should just face the facts.  I'M A TERRIBLE GAMBLER.  Or maybe God's trying to tell me something (?).

Church today was awesome!  Taka painted a picture from the book of Revelation (leadership stuff in Revelation?) of what Spirit lead leadership should look like.  I'm debating on volunteering putting them up on our website so other people can benefit from his messages.  SOOOO GOOD!
