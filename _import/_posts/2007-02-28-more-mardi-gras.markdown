I found more pictures that my friend posted on Facebook so I thought I'd post more.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jevy/405813213/" class="tt-flickr"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/148/405813213_759708bda8_m.jpg" alt="Cry Face" border="0" height="160" width="240" /></a>Sarah and Brit giving a "word" to this guy.  I love his makeup.

While I try not to judge these guys, they'll figure out one day that this type of confrontation really doesn't help anything. In fact, it may worsen it. Love is the answer, as so many poets have already written.  If you have been slighted by these types of people. I'm sorry. No one's perfect but don't give up on God because sometimes we miss represent Him.
