There are times when you look over just at the right time to connect.  Raising an eyebrow and gentle smile in your mind, but never in reality as to cause suspicion of interest.  Even if it's unintended the heart seems to jump to life.

Dear self: Do I want to pursue this?  It makes life so much more complicated... that it greatly limits the options.  Not for other women (which is really not something that matters if you've found someone that works well with you), but what must be given up for a relationship.  Oh the freedom of life right now.

Note to everyone: I'm practicing writing in a more thoughtful style.  w0rd
