So I'm just trying out adding <tag>tags</tag> to my blog so that <tag>technorati</tag> will be able to pick it up.  The site's pretty cool but will get better once more people start using it.  It shows what people are blogging about _right now_ based on the tags that they are specifying right now.  We shall see!

<tags>blogging, news</tags>
