I feel like everything's falling out from under me.  It's more than likely a feeling that's brought on by sitting at home on a Friday night holding a remote in one hand an a bag of pretzels in the other.

The solution?  Some time in the Word and a quality froster.  Total? $1.83.  Life is much better ;)

Seriously though, I'm really grateful to everyone who comes to check out my blog.  It's nice to know that people want to keep up with me.. or at the _very least_ get dirt on me :o
