Movies watched over the "break"
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099674/">Godfather III</a> - The last 30 seconds were my favorite.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212346/">Miss Congeniality</a> - I got sucked into it!  I swear!  It was a fun movie though..</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/">Batman Begins</a> - Second time around.. still great</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208629/">Nuremberg </a>- Good</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430105/">Four Brothers</a> - Mega slick.  Andre 3000 baby.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352248/">Cinderella Man</a> - Probably the most intense movie I've seen for awhile.  I'm sure my Grandma almost had a heart attack.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408306/">Munich </a>- Pretty long.  Not sure what type of movie this was supposed to be: Religious, Political, Thriller, Action?  Good though</li>
