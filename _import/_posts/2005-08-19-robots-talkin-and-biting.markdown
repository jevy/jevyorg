So I spent 10am-1am with about 2 hours of break on Wed night finishing up the robots.  I made a video of how I progressed which I'll compile and post soon.

They loved my presentation.  I'm going to be presenting again for the Dean at 2:30pm on Monday but that should be fine as these programs have already worked well under pressure ;)  I'll also post of the robots doing stuff a bit later.
