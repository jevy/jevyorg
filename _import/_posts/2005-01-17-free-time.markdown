Okay, this will really sound really lame and make it sound like "everyone wants to hang out with me" but it's really not, it's just a practical way to let those people who like me (please love me) and who I really dig hanging out with know my schedule.

Below are the free times I have this week.  If anyone wants to hang out/grab a beer/play squash please drop me an email or private comment.

Tuesday - Doing homework all night
Wednesday - free after 11:30am.  Would love to play squash then grab a beer here.
Thursday - class 11:30am-2:30pm.  Squash afterwards?
Friday - Probably free from 12:30-1:30
