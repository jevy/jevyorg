So I've decided to give up on my clock radio.  There isn't too much work left for it but I kinda lost interest since I usually get up five minutes before my alarm goes off anyways.

So here's my dream project: develop tiny modules, that are self aware of their location (gps or otherwise), that communicate with each other via a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking">mesh network</a>.  Ideally, they should each be flexible enough that they could have different sensors attached and broadcast that information using the same protocol.

So many interesting technologies to look into.  So many papers to read!  I don't even know where to start really..

.. or maybe I just need more to do these evenings.
