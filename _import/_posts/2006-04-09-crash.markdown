I've been wanting to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375679/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHNvdXJjZWlkPW1vemlsbGEtc2VhcmNofHE9Y3Jhc2h8ZnQ9MXxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8Y289MXxodG1sPTF8bm09MQ__;fc=1;ft=208;fm=1">this </a>movie but everyone's already seen it.  So what the heck?  So Jimmy boy came over and we watched.  So stinking good.  I watched the last half of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119488/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9bC5hLiBjb25maWRlbmNpYWx8ZnQ9MXxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8Y289MXxodG1sPTF8bm09MQ__;fc=1;ft=20;fm=1">L.A. Confidential</a> last night when I got home.  Both of these put together really make me quite afraid of L.A. and all that terribly scary things that I'm sure happen there.  The music?  <a href="http://www.birdyork.com/index-main.html">Stellar</a>...

Racism is somewhat of a weird concept to me I think.  I mean, I more than likely hold my own stereotypes about certain people groups, but to see anything actually being acted out I have never experienced.  While in <a href="http://www2.occdsb.on.ca/mth/">St. Matt's</a>, I would hear that there were some pretty big racial issues going on.  Maybe I didn't see them because I was part of the 90% majority.  Maybe suburbia isn't the greatest place after all. :(
