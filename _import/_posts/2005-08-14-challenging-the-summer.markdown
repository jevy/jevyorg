So I like the idea of a challenge.  I don't mind giving my all for this project for another 5 days.  I can deal.

The bible is a solid book.  I really want to learn it more so that I can share and understand for myself what He might do/say in a particular situation and it's not just my ideas/concepts.  Even if you're not a Christian it's a good read.
