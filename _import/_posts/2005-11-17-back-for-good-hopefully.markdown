Well, I decided to format jevy.org as it got hacked.  I have no idea what they did to the system so I figure it was better to start anew.  It feels nice when everything's fresh but I've got plenty to setup.  After working with Linux for close to nice years, you think you'd have it all figured out.. well... no such luck.  Anyways, if things are still acting wonky, let me know.

I'll be working on my new site during exams if I can motivate myself between studying sessions.  I think I might be too ambicious though :P

Things are really swell!  Had a blast roadtripping down to Guelph last weekend to visit some old and new friends down there.  It was an opportune time as midterms were pretty well done and I just needed a break.  Really refreshing.  That said, two weeks of class left.  Then it's that make-my-own-hours time of year as exams gear up.  Shazzam!

<strong>Update</strong>:  ARGH!  I want to post some pictures really badly but I still have to fix some things on this site first.  GAH!  Maybe tomorrow?
