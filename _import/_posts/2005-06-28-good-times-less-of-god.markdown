Hummm.. maybe that title is misleading.  Things have been going really well in the past week or so so I feel my dependence on God is less.  That sorta makes sense right?  "I'm fine, I don't need you right now".  So I pray less and simply think less about God and that I am <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%204:13-16;&version=49;">literally nothing</a> without Him.  So, it's time to dig deeper and pray that He can use me to help show this love that He has for me for others and to give Him praise for what He's done in my life.

I really want to redo this webpage but the designs never look as they are in my head lol.

	<li>This <a href="http://www.vickybeeching.com/">Vicky Beeching</a> CD is SICK!  I had no idea how much I've missed this style of rockin', power worship.  I guess you'd have to hear it to know.  They have some samples on the site.  I'd recommend it.</li>
	<li>Saturday was my ARRL first field day that I've been in.  I went for five hours Saturday afternoon and had a blast.  23 contacts!  Not bad considering the radio and antenna.  Some pictures from the one I was at <a href="http://www.oarc.net/photos/oarc_field_day_2005/">here </a>and <a href="http://www.oarc.net/photos/oarc_field_day_2_2005/">here</a>.  It was awesome when I showed up to a bunch of 45 year olds sitting in lawn chairs under a tree:
Jevy: "Is this field day?"
Richard: Looks around at the radios "Good guess, you hungry"
Jevy: "I just ate thanks"
Everyone: "You're one skinny guy.. eat up!"
Jevy: "Wow!  That's a lot of mac and cheese!  You guys eating this for the whole 24 hours?"
Everyone: Laughter.
Richard: "haha.. eat up"
