title: Who&#8217;s Smart?

It's funny the reaction I get from people when I tell them I'm studying engineering:
* "ohhhhhhh"
* "wow, you must be really smart"
* "one of my roomie's an engineer, we never see him"
* "you must drink a lot"

While it's true that perhaps we have a heavier workload than most, I don't understand why people automatically assuming that engineers are smarter than those who aren't.  I mean, I'd die you gave me three readings of 20 pages each a week!  Holy crap!  Why are the maths and sciences considered "smarter" than others?  How come those who have really good social skills aren't considered "smart" or how about mothers who raise their kids really well, is this not smart?  A musician?  An electrician?

It's true, these all require different kind of smarts.  If that's the case, do we as a society look down on some career choices than others?  For example, what parent actually aspires their son/daughter to become a plumber?  Probably very few.  It doesn't really make sense since they make really good money and it has some real job security.  I think it's great to see that there are finally advertising trades in places like movie theatres to atract those who maybe do have those smarts to that particular area of work.  <a href="http://www.careersintrades.ca/">Careersintrades.ca</a> for example.

All that said.. back to studying Quantum Mechanics for Tuesday lol.
