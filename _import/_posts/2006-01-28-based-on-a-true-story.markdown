<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363771/"><img width="65" height="96" alt="Narnia" id="image241" class="alignleft" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/29m.thumbnail.jpg" /></a>Went this afternoon with <a href="http://flat-scan.livejournal.com/">Rob </a>to see Narnia this afternoon.  What a fantastic movie.  Not to mention that it's based on a true story!!

This movie makes me wish I was at war.  Not that I'd enjoy seeing people die but for the reason of having a very tangeble view of what I am living for.  For example, during WWII, the world had a purpose to destroy and push back the Nazis.  Today what is the purpose being thrown at us?  Find a good job, get money, get a nice computer, play some video games, have a nice family, retire, sit on a beach somewhere then die.  Is this not how life is "supposed" to look for us?

From the perspective of the bible, we are in fact at war.  God has a plan for me (and for everyone reading this too!) and desires for us to step into it.  Is it more worthwhile than retiring sipping margaritas on a sunny beach?  Well, Christ when he came said this:
<blockquote><span id="en-NIV-26480" class="sup" />I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. He will come in and go out, and find pasture. <span id="en-NIV-26481" class="sup" />The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.

-- <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2010:9-10;&version=31;">Matthew 10:9-10</a></blockquote>
So what does that practically look like for you?  Well, I don't know.  I do know that God created you and so I'm sure he knows how that you can have life to the full.  Mind you, he's not our suger daddy per se but he does want a relationship.  I hope you guys don't find this cheesy over over spiritual.  I just think it makes sense.

Update: Hopefully all cleared up <a href="http://jevy.org/2006/01/30/crazy-war-lover/">here</a>.
