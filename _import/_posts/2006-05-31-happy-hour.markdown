This humidity is killer.  Really though, it really makes you feel alive.  There really isn't anything like sweating like a maple tree and cracking the beer in the afternoon.  My roomie's making fajitas and the dance music is pumping in my room.  Somehow it all seems to work.

I have so many things that I want to "start" this summer but feel that I can't until I get other stuff off my place.  I want to let it all slide until the end of the summer but my gut knows that that would be bad news.
