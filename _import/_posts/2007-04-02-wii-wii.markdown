So for Alex, Brendan, and Matt's birthday party I rented a Wii for the weekend.  The flip side was I wanted to play it myself to see if I wanted to get one.

<strong>Party #1: Birthday</strong>

We played Tennis, Boxing, Wario Smooth Moves (glorious!), Wii Cooking Mama, Monkey Ball and Rayman Raging Rabbits.  I have to say watching people get into the games is an absolute hoot!  I can why people have these Wii-motes slipping and smashing TVs-- my hands were crazy sweaty!!  Personaly, I had a blast playing tennis and Wario Smooth Moves.  Wario was probably _the_ most random game I have ever played and I was laughing the whole way through!  The downside is you have to finish the game before you can do multiplayer.  Boo!

<strong> Party #2:</strong>

Four of us played Wario and pretty much all the Wii sports. I was as bad at golf as I am in real life therefore it's realistic?  Umm..  maybe.  Anyways, we had a blast playing Wario.  I think they enjoyed the randomness as much as I did.  Man the elephant moves were always the hardest.
