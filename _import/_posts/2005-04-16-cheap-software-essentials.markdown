I wrote this a little while ago but never posted it.  Here are my software essentials:

<strong>MP3 Player</strong> - <ahref="http://www.foobar2000.org/">foobar</a> - This MP3 player initially looks like a really minimal, basic looking MP3 player.  To start out, that's exactly what it is.  It takes very little memory and focusses on excellent sound quality.  The beauty of this program are the many plugins you can download to extend what you want this player to do.  It is a great player for having multiple playlists and tons of MP3s.  The sorting feature is also great -- I have all my playlists sorted by Genre.  It can look really basic (for a quick load) but some people make an art out of it.

<p>
Essential foobar plugins<p>
<ul><li>Audioscrobbler - audioscrobbler.com
<li>foo_pod - Use foobar to manage your iPod, way more control than iTunes.
<li>HTTP Reader - Now standard in the download but useful since I love <a href="http://www.shoutcast.com">internet radio</a>.
<li>ID3v2
<li>Massdelete - Delete files on your computer directly from the playlist
<li>Replaygain - This will add a <a href="http://www.replaygain.org/">replaygain</a> tag to your MP3.  Basically standardizing the volume for all your songs.  No longer do you have to play with your volume for every song!
<li>winamp_spam - This emulates Winamp's API so my livejournal program can detect what song is playing.  Very slick.
<li>foo_cue_ex - This is key for those Trance sets.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>MP3 Splitter</strong> - <a href="http://www.mpesch3.de/">3DirectCut</a> - Split up those cue files or clean up MP3s that have silence.  FREEWARE!
<p>
<strong>MP3 Ripper </strong>- Exact Audio Copy (EAC)
<p>
<strong>Text Edittor</strong> - <a href="http://www.vim.org/">ViM</a>
<p>
<strong>Browser</strong> - Firefox - The best browser hands down.  100% free and is very small and fast.  Pretty minimal to start but you can get all kinds of extensions (plugins) to make for a better browsing experience.  You have to love the tabs.
<p>
Essential Firefox Extensions
<ul><li>Radial Context - Not for everyone but I really like it.  It creates a <a href="http://www.piemenus.com/">Pie menu</a> are your cursor.  It makes browser super fast.
	<li>BugMeNot - This will bypass compulsory web registration with the context menu.  ie. newyorktimes.com etc.
	<li>Web Developer - Adds a menu and a toolbar with various web developer tools.
	<li>Single Window - Catches all "open link in new window" requests and opens them in a new tab instead.  That way you only have one window to deal with.</ul>
<p>
<strong>Email Client</strong> - Thunderbird - Great email client also by Mozilla.  Includes built in junk mail filtering.  Awesome alternative to Outlook Express.
<p>
<strong>Bittorrent Client</strong> - <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">Azureus</a>
<p>
<strong>Image viewer</strong> - <a href="http://www.irfanview.com/">Irfanview</a> - This has been out for a couple of years.  It is very simliar to ACDSEE which is great but not free.  Irfanview is free though.
<p>
<strong>RSS Agressor</strong> - <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines.com</a> - Since I like to use tabs and firefox, an online aggressor is what I had to use.  Bloglines is amazing.  Very intuitive and even has helper applications to let you know when new news items are listed.
