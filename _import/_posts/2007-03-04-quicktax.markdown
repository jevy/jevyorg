As I am typing this with one hand, the other is holding the phone listening to silence.  It has been literally 5 minutes since I've heard anything from the other side and the thing is-- I know someone's there.

I decided to call up quicktax to ask a question regarding their software.  Here's how it went:
<blockquote>
Automated machine: "Thanks for calling.  The wait is approx. 15 minutes".  No music.. nothing.

* 15 minutes later*

Guy: *Indian accent* Hello, thank you for calling Quicktax.  Can I get your phone number and name.
Me: Sure.. *name and number*
Guy: Thank you Jevin, can you please login for me please.
Me: Sure!  ... done!
Guy: Thank you.  What can I do for you.
Me: I can't seem to figure out how to transfer donations and education payouts to next year when I really need it.  How do I do that.
Guy: One moment.  *I head the taping on the keyboard*

* 5 minutes pass *
Me: Soooo.  I'm sorry, are you waiting on me?
Guy: Have you logged it yet?
Me: Uhhh yep!  Have been for awhile now.
Guy:  Oh!  Okay..

* 5 minutes *
Me:  Soo.. how's it coming?
Guy:  So you're logged in right?
Me:  *I'm thinking is this for real?*  How about I email you guys.
Guy: Can I get your email?
Me:  Thank you!!  Goodbye!!!</blockquote>

Eek!
