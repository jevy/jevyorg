I had heard from a girl it was <a href="http://www.realizem/title/tt0427944/">good movie</a> and imdb has rarely let me down.  It was nice, light movie, for $3 and 90 minutes of your time you can't go wrong.  It was witty and subtle so much so that I'd want to laugh but realise I'm the only one that would be laughing so I had to hold it in.  Not that I was able to "get the jokes" more than others but I think everyone was probably doing the same thing.  </span>  <span class="imagelink">Can I just say that ever since I read a review of Katie Holmes being a "woody" character, in every movie I've seen since I just can't help to think how accurate of a statement that actually is.  She's so hollow and never draws you in.  BOO!  Maybe it's because some of that <a href="http://www.tomcruiseisnuts.com/">creepy dude</a> has been wearing off on her. </span>
