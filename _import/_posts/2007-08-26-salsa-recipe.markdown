It's unfortunate that I can't eat some of my favorite foods but thankfully there are some that I can still eat.  Salsa for example is one of those things.  I've been making salsa since I was about 12 or 13 and make a bunch every couple of months.  I decided this week that it was time to see if I could make my salsa even better!  The heat is medium.

6+ jars and 4 hours later, here's the recipe I put together.  It's fully organic and candida friendly. :D

To make 4 cups/salsa (one mason jar)
<ol>
	<li>Combine in a medium pot:
<ul>
	<li>5 cups of diced tomatoes</li>
	<li>3 Green Onions diced</li>
	<li>2 Green Peppers chopped</li>
	<li>4 Garlic cloves minced</li>
	<li>2-4 Jalapenios to taste</li>
	<li>1 tea spoon of salt</li>
	<li>2 table spoons of lime juice</li>
	<li>2 table spoons of lemon juice</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon of cumin spice</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Mix well, bring to a boil and let simmer for an hour or so.  The tomatoes will boil down and some of the liquid will evaporate.</li>
</ol>

Enjoy!
