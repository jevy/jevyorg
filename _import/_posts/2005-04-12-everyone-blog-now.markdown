Everyone needs to blog!  EVERYONE!  Why?  It's simply the best way to keep up with people.  This is my own personal opinion, but I love finding out what people think, random thoughts or what you're feeling regarding life!  I'm not so interested in your grandma coming over to dinner, but I am interested if she told you crazy stories about what she did in her small town or if she hunted on some exotic island (I think it's Lost coming through).

More stuff that I love reading:
<ul>
	<li>Thoughts of spirituality</li>
	<li>Geeky stuff</li>
	<li>Thoughts and interpretations of movies</li>
	<li>The latest music/song that you love that you want other people to experience</li>
	<li>Frustrations with society/media/life and looking for advice</li>
	<li>An open invitation for feedback on poetry, art, music etc.  Anything that helps me dream or get some creative brainwaves going on.</li>
</ul>

Those are all things that I love and I guess post often.  That said, is their anything that you guys your suggest me posting more about?  I mean, this is my blog but I want to give other people insight into what I'm thinking.  Not in a selfish way, but I want to be transparent with you.
