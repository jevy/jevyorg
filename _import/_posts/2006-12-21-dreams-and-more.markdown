So there desiring to learn about about God works.  I see stuff in the bible that I don't see going on much anymore.  If it really is the same God, shouldn't He be doing the same stuff?

Anyways, a couple of weeks ago, this Christian guy from Montreal came down to Ottawa to teach on dreams, their significance and how to interpret them.  Incredible stuff!  I didn't realize how much the bible put an emphasis on dreams.  Anyways, so I started my own little wiki using <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki </a>to record my own dreams and the interpretations and I work through them.  If you have a dream you want to share, I need practice interpreting and I'd love to try it.  Not guarantees but I'd like to try.  Emailing me is probably best: jevin@techie.com.
