Well, I made the switch to Wordpress.  I feel more 1336 than 1337 today now that I switched to not only a ready made blogging program, but an entire website based on it.  Oh well.  The default theme is pretty sweet and I'll keep it until I get my own up and running.

You guys should really get RSS feeds going.  It's built straight into Firefox.  If you don't like that, use bloglines.  No more of this Livejournal stuff.  Now that I have a perm RSS <a href="feed:http://jevy.org/wp-rss2.php">feed</a>, people should read that as posting to <a href="http://www.livejournal.com">LJ </a>takes awhile.

Took this cute picture awhile back but haven't posted it.
