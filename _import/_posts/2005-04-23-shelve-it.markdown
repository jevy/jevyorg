The year's nearly done.  Looking back I don't remember much.  It really just whizzed by.  I think the remember the most are simply the people.  I hung out with some much more and some, well, never compared to other years.  I think circumstances just tend to change these things.

Other stuff?  I've grown spiritually which is really a solid investment.  I'm finding myself reading the Word and simply meditating/praying/contemplating those words.  So much comfort in them.

Whatever, one exam left and then what?  I'm not a fan of being rejecting from everything from Starbucks to actual Eng jobs.  Looks like I have to throw that out the door and try to find a local place downtown that I can make some cash (not to mention a change of pace from a lab with no windows in the summer).  If anyone knows of a place downtown O-town that's hiring, do let me know!
