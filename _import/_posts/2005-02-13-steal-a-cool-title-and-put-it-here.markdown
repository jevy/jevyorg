I really desire creativity.  If someone knows where it comes from, let me know and I'll buy it online.  ;)
Trying to come up with something fresh for my website.  So hard to do!
Trying to write some music that doesn't sound like something else.  Stinking rough!
Come up with some fashionable style of my own?  Well, I've got jeans and a hoodie on now so I'm on my way.
Telling my own jokes?  Well, I don't really.. I just talk about life and people seem to enjoy that haha.

Really though.  I feel I need to _justify_ my lack of creativity or something.  Does that even make sense?  "How many people actually write creative music, not many, so I shouldn't feel bad".  Maybe I'm just looking for a new way to express myself.  I'm definitely feeling the imbalance of my brain these days.  The left is screaming for a break while the right is turning to mush... or something.
