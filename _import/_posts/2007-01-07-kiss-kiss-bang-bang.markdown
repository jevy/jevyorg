If you guys are up for an honest, fun, action movie with really fun characters, go rent <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373469/">Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</a>.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000375/">Robert Downey Jr.</a>'s character was hilarious!  He was such a clueless character who just seemed to walk and just coast through life.  I'm laughing just thinking about it.  A really good light movie to watch with friends.  Good pick Nora!
