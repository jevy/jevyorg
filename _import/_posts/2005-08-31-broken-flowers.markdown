Went out with Jimmy tonight to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412019/">Broken Flowers</a>.  I'm a sucker for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000195/">Bill Murray</a> so it was no brainer.  I had high hopes since <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/">Lost in Translation</a> is one of my top 3 movies of all time.  I'm all about character movies and this movie does not dissapoint.  Murray is woody in this movie but you get little glimpses of his deep core from time to time showing that there is a certain level of emotionalism and attachment that he has.  I dunno I would recommend it.  Warning:  It's pretty slow moving movie.  3.5/5
