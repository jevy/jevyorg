I remember watching it at Anne Neuyan's house back in high school.  The movie is sorta confusing but by the end it all comes together.  The music is simply amazing and I can't stop listening to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0933896/">Nancy Wilson</a>'s - Elevator Beat who turns out to be the director's wife!  Making it a scandel or something..

Anyways, I really love Cruz and Cruise's relationship in the movie.  Gental and touching.
