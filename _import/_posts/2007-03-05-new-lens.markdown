So, I don't like to really talk about stuff I buy, but I needed to mention this.

I'm not sure if I have "the shakes" or what, but so many of my pictures turn out blurry from me moving the camera too much.  Even with my 50mm f/1.8 lens, things come out blurry.  WHAT THE HECK?

So, today I got a stinking good deal on the Nikon 18-200mm VR lens.

Who needs friends?  I have this lens!
