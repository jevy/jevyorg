I was talking with my brother on the phone today and I just started crying.  I realized something in my heart that was wrong and I apologized to him.  Weird thing is, I didn't feel anything until I actually spoke it to him.  This healing feels kinda good!  Well afterwards anyways.

I'm so vulnerable.

A great ultimate game really helped.
