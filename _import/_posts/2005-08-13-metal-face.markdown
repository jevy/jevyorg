So I had a nightmare the other night that while I was soldering, I got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering">solder </a>in my eye.  I didn't anything of it so I left it there.  Anyways, it started rusting, I went blind in the eye, then the other.  I don't remember the rest but I probably died somehow.

.. so now I wear goggles.
