I don't read much, but when I do, they are usually very good.  So I'll try to post a couple of them.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Pi-Yann-Martel/dp/184195425X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1195695129&sr=8-1">Life of Pi</a> is one of those books you either love it (and you get it), or love to hate it (and you maybe don't get it).  I've met people in both camps.  When people ask: "what is it about?" there really isn't a clear answer.
<blockquote>
Them: "So what's it about?"
Us: "It's about this boy.. and a tiger.. out at sea in a lifeboat.. and well.. that's like.. it!"
Them: "Wow.. sounds lame"
Us: "Actually, it's amazing"
</blockquote>
I loves stories.  Especially stories that express people's deepest emotions.  This book is about Pi (actually the character's name!), his search for spirituality and then his time on the life boat.  Yann Martel has an incredible ability to describe the scene without having it be overwhelming or monotonous.  I remember reading this during second year university and it allowed me to recapture the imaginative side that perhaps I was loosing among all the Calculus and Mechanics/Dynamics courses I was taking at the time.  This realization came to me on the way home from a long day of classes.  I can still vividly remember the whole scene.  I was so lighthearted and satisfied for the rest of the day.  It's like I had found something that was lost!
