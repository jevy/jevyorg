LOL!  A guy in my bible study sent us all these "Christian pickup lines".  So very sketchy, but quite hilarious.  Here's what he said:

well boys, the big V day is coming up so I thought I would help some of you out. Here are some classic pick up lines for meeting christian ladies, I've used a few of these myself in the past. Now some of you may say that these are cheesy and  dumb, but the ones who say that are probablly single, so suck it up princess, and put these lines to good use.

10. "I just don't feel called to celibacy."
9. "Did I tell you that my great-uncle was a personal friend of Billy Graham? "
8."I don't see it myself, but people tell me I look like Michael W. Smith."
7. "What do you think Paul meant when he said, 'Greet everyone with a holy kiss'?"
6."You have the body of Amy Grant and the soul of Mother Teresa." (DO NOT get this confused!)
5. "You know, I'm really into relationship evangelism."
4. "I'm pretty flexible--I don't think a woman should be submissive on the first date."
3. "Before tonight, I never believed in predestination..."
2. "Just looking at you makes me feel all ecumenical."
1. "I hear there's going to be a love offering tonight."
