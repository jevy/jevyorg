I was playing with <a href="http://freemind.sf.net">freemind</a>, a mind mapping program.  Wish it could come out in image format but it came out to html.  Aw well:

<p>Wicked Summer
<ul><li>Experience Needed

</li>
<li>Stuff I'd love to do
<ul><li>Learn some quality 1920s jazz stuff for guitar
<ul><li>Write some?

</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Work 15-20 hrs a week to sustain some cash flow (!)

</li>
<li>Bike everywhere

</li>
<li>Night photography

</li>
<li>Find a sweet local bar

</li>
<li>Get some VHF DX contacts

</li>
<li>Build into the Christians from school who are around

</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
