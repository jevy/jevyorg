Up until just a couple of days ago, I was super frustrated with not doing a mission trip this summer.  Despite the fact that I know that getting some engineering experience is good for and that I have done mission trips for the past 4 years, I'm still anxious.  I'm realizing that perhaps my motives for going aren't completely to serve Him which is what we should be doing out of love and not ritualistic reasons or fear.  I think I want to go to be able to tell stories!  Meet all kinds of people from across Canada!  Hang out and explore places that are beyond my daily adventures.

Now I'm not say those motivations are particularly wrong, but if I shift my thinking to: "well, I've given this summer to God to do what He feels is best for me, then so be it!  I'll be cool with that" instead of reasons specified above, then I think that is a better perspective to have.  So now I'm feeling a lot better about what's coming up in the next four months.  Not sure if that makes sense.

The textures came out really well, best at a large size:
