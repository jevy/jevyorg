title: Community and Me

I have recently realized that I naturally tend to experience and create community with the people around me.  I first started thinking about this when I was walking down the university hallways with a buddy of mine from class!  I literally said "hi" to maybe 4-5 people that afternoon.  He was amazed at the amount of people I knew.

We are all energized in different ways.  For me, I gain energy from being around people and growing deep with them.  So I naturally spend a significant amount of energy creating pockets of communities in different places.  Looking back, I can now see why so many different groups, organizations and activities I had been involved with were highlights of my life.  There's something about being with a group of people in a very intense environment (e.g. a musical, missions trip, sports team) that brings people close together.  These were some of my most cherished times as I grew to know those I was with in a deeper and meaningful way.

Amazing how we're all wired.  I hope this wasn't as disjointed as it seemed when I wrote it.
