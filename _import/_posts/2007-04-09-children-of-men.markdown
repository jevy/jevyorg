<a href='http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/10m.jpg' title='Children of Men'><img src='http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/10m.jpg' alt='Children of Men' /></a>On a day where I am supposed to be studying for exams (whatever.. we're good), I decided to watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206634/">Children of Men</a>.  Wow!  Talk about not what you expected.  I felt this movie was mainly a commentary on society today and the direction where we will be heading.  It was suspenseful the entire way through but left a lot of (unimportant?) questions unanswered.  I'm trying to be intensionally vague without giving any of it away.  It's a beautiful, dark movie about fighting for what is right.  Check it out!
