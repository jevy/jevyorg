So we have our annual beer with two teachers from high school.  I fear however, one is senile.  Here's a letter we just got after he had already confirmed the time.  What the HECK?!?!?!
<blockquote>
Dorks all dorks,
Gifted, my Aunt Fanny.......................... eating at some place I've never heard of, no die-rections, no offer to pick me up, no contact with Curtis, .....................  for all I know the wings stink and the beer is warm.  Gifted pain in the butt--- the whole lot of you.

Communicate you turkeys................... and you guys have a degree or two.  Geez man, I think I deserve a PhD in Pain Relief.

Regards,
Wm.

PS  The real judge will be holding Kangaroo Court and you won't be getting off this time, Nora.  Winner gets my old jacket.
PPS  Jev, is there a God?  Can't be when they stick me with guys like this. Hell on earth, I suppose.
