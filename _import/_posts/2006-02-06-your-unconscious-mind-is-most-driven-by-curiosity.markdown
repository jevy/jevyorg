This is <a href="http://uk.tickle.com/test/inkblot/start.html">one sweet test</a>!  I'm trying not to put too much weight on it but it got some points bang on.
<img width="96" height="96" alt="Curiosity" id="image249" class="alignright" src="http://jevy.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/curiosity.thumbnail.jpg" />You are full of questions about life, people, and your own potential. You spend more time than others imagining the possibilities for your life â€“ and you're open to things others are too afraid to consider. You have an almost physical need to know and do more. It's only through new experiences that you feel a greater understanding of yourself and the world. You also have a rebellious streak that shows up when you feel unable to truly influence the world or circumstances around you. Your appetite for novel experiences also shows an openness others don't have, but wish they did. Your psyche is very rich; the more you learn about it, the more you will understand who you really are.
