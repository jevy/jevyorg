So off to Blockbuster we went.  <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/travy_pp/">Travy</a> picked the winner tonight.  With a seemingly random "Les Choristes".  Turns out to be awesome!  The ladies were giggling and "aww"ing the entire way through and the guys were laughing for sure!  A simple heart warming experience.

Cross between <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097165/">Dead Poets Society</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113862/">Mr. Holland's Opus</a>.  With a bit of an open end which I always love. 4.5/5
