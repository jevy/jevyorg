Don't get me wrong.  It's a fun city to visit but I'm quite certain I could never live there.  I went down to visit a bunch of friends I had made over the years.  On one of the nights I went to an "alumni dinner" thing where C4C is trying to connect grads an help equip and encourage them in the work place.  Step in the right direction for sure!

I was taking the subway back from my friend's place listening to some United Live.  As I was walking out of the Queen stop and girl turns to me and starts talking:
<blockquote>Her: *something*

Me: *Pulls off headphones* Pardon me?

Her: I said, you have a beautiful voice.</blockquote>
.. I was floored.  I don't think anyone's said that before.  Maybe because I don't sing in public much anymore... or maybe she was flirting with me.  In any case, I was surprised and I'm sure I went beat red.

<strong>Update</strong>: Oh yeah, what I really wanted to mention was that I had a hard time connecting with people.  Being a fifth year, the people who I knew back in first year are either a) gone or b) on staff with CRU.  My friend Margie said it well: "Jev, you're time is done here.. don't sweat it".  She was bang on.  I knew it, but I needed to hear it a different way I guess.
The theme was global village for the New Years party.  My costume:
