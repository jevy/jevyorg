So what does it mean when I have no email in my inbox?  It means I have replied to everyone, and wrote down in my agenda all that's left to do.  What a great feeling!  My email isn't gone forever though, it's just all archived.  It's truly a discipline to reply to email instead of letting it marinate for days and days.
