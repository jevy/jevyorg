Alright, it's true.  After a year of planning and prayer, we (as five different Christian clubs/churches involved on campus)  worked together to put on the "<a href="http://www.iagreewithpercy.com">I Agree With Percy</a>" campaign.  I think it's a solid way to get people talking about what they believe and hear about guy who had his life changed through his relationship with Christ.  I'm also praying that this will be an opportunity for me to talk with fellow university peeps about what I believe.

It's amazing though, I've already read/hear negative feedback (including from our own chaplain) about this campaign.  The greatest thing is that nobody cares about any sorta campaign that happends (with one or two notable exceptions)  unless it's Christian!  Even if it's nothing more than people wearing T-Shirts, putting up some posters, writting on some chalkboards and having a really interesting guy speak twice, people go balistic.

.. all adds to the hype I guess ;)

Anyways, check out the site.
