I'm still undecided if I want a job or not.  The main reason for a job is to get STINKING MOTIVATED and to simply meet people.  I was thinking that being a cook in some local pub somewhere would be cool.  It would be super busy (love it), intense (I love the pressure), can work on my cooking skillz (if only I had nunchuck or computer hacking skillz), and meet a wide variety of cats.  Maybe?  We'll see how things pan out this week.
