Well, the NSERC grant didn't come through so that's out for the summer.  However, I did get my application in for the Shad program facilitator for the month of July.  That would be awesome if I got in with that.  However, a one month job won't cut it.  I'm working on my resume and cover letters these past couple of days.  Man!  It's such an involved process!

In other news, I got destroyed in Squash today by a guy I met last week.  He was trying to take it easy on me (I could tell) but he still had me running around the court.  It was quite a humbling experience let me tell ya.

I was watching on the news about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp">Auschwitz concentration camp</a>.  Tomorrow marks the 60th anniversary of it's liberation.  It's literally incomprehensible some of the things the Nazis did.  It really didn't hit me until you say pictures of the people in the camps.  Such beautiful women gases and burned.  It's not so much the beauty that struck me, but the fact that these were real people, each with their own story.   Not just that but such an awesome number of them just obliterated.  I'm not sure.  I'm grateful that we are remembering this, that the story can once again be told.  <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/national/rex/">Rex Murphy</a> had a great view point tonight.  I wish I remembered the quote but something to the effect that we can't forget this terrible evil, lest it may happen again.
