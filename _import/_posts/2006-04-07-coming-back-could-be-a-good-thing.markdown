<a href="http://blameitonthedlu.blogspot.com/2006/04/being-old-gaurd.html">Some</a> are getting anxious about coming back to school for (essentially) a fifth year while others have gone and flown away.  I am included in this group but am rethinking about how I feel about the whole thing:

Yesterday night I was out at a multi-church function here in Orleans so we were just of mingling:
<blockquote><strong>Linda</strong>: Hi!  I'm Linda
<strong>Me</strong>: Hi!  I'm Jevin
<strong>Linda</strong>:  Jevinnnnnnn.. I know Jevin.  You went to Pioneer camp right?
<strong>Me</strong>: Whoa yeah!  I haven't been there in years!
<strong>Linda</strong>: Yeah!  You know my daughter and son!
<strong>Me</strong>: Oh sure thing!  (I actually remembered at this point).  How are they?
<strong> Linda</strong>:  Well, the daughter is 24 who got married a couple years back and has a 5 month old now.
<strong> Me</strong>: *Short stunned silence remembering I asked this cute girl to run the triathalon, she denied me so I got someone else and won anyways ;)*.  Wow yeah, cool stuff!</blockquote>
This morning at the dentist:

Young Dental Hygienist Lady:  Sorry about working on this tooth so long.  There's a lot of build up.  It's obvious you don't floss!
<blockquote><strong>Me</strong>:  I floss like three times a week!
<strong>Dental Hygienist: </strong>You need to floss like _everyday_
<strong>Me</strong>:  Will do.
<strong>Dental Hygienist: </strong>Why high school did you go to?
<strong>Me</strong>: St. Matt's.  Class of 2002.  You?
<strong>Dental Hygienist</strong>:<strong> </strong> I went to Garneau.  Same year.  *Note: Garneau is for the public french around here.  I know one person who graduated that year*
<strong>Me</strong>: We talked about who we thought we knew at the other's school but really we had no idea their names, just faces.</blockquote>
Anyways, that's a long story that basicly says that I'm a) Happy I don't have kids (yet) and b) Glad that I'm not working at a full time job right now.  The more I think about it I'm fully enjoying my summers and (relatively) lots of free time during university.  So bring on the victory lap year baby.
