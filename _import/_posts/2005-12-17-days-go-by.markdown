.. Dirty Vegas.  That was a great song.  But really the reason for this post:

Dear Lord,
It's all flying by.  Nearly too fast.  How do I enjoy every minute?!  Don't let a day pass me by without knowing that today I did your will.  Then, on days where my shortsightedness blinds my heart... I can stand.
Your "blah"ed out son,
Jevin
