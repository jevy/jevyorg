Google rocks.  What is there left to say.  We've all been using their search engine exclusively for years.  Now I've forwarded all my email to gmail and even <a href="http://jevy.org/2006/11/21/organized-email/">bragged </a>about how efficient it is.  I use <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> exclusively for maps.  Yesterday I was getting fed up with Bloglines and their RSS reader so I decided to give <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> a shot.  Absolute glory.  I was sold in 10 minutes.

So here's the problem, Google could destroy my life if it wanted to know.  It knows everything I read, all my friends, all my most personal email -- everything!  I don't really like to admit that an other commercial entity has the power to own me but it's true.  Oh well, I guess that deserve it?
