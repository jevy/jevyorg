Could it be?

I went out tonight from a musical put on by some high schoolers at the Bronson Centre on well.. Bronson.  When I got home Caleb was sitting outside listening to some quiet trance music inside.  I go into my room to start reading when Phil Collins comes on (I love Phil).  Caleb comes inside and changes it to another Trance set.  By this point I felt good.

I come out a while later to clean the dishes and just then Caleb's getting into it!  Kinda throwing his fist in the ear just as the beat kicks in and tapping his foot.  He's going to read this and be in denial, but I know the truth and all these people reading this know the truth because I'm the most trustworthy person in the world!
