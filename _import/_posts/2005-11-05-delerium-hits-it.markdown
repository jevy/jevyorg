Who says that Techno music has no depth!  I'm loving it tonight..  it's a choon for sure:
<blockquote>
I know good things, I know bad as well
Any witness to the world will tell
If there is sorrow, then there is beauty and trust
A secret pearl inside the heart of us...

So truly, if there's light then I want to see it
Now that I know what I am looking for
Truly, if there's joy then I want to feel it
Here in this world is where I want to be
'Cause I can't cry anymore
-- Delerium - Truly
