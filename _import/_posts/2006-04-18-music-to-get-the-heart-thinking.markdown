The Narnia Score and Soundtrack is incredible (Evacuating London being my favorite tune).  I'm torn between buying the soundtrack or the movie since they're close to the same price.  I still maintain that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004581/">Harry Gregson-Williams</a> is the most talented composer for movies around.  He.. and well.. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001877/">Hans Zimmer</a>.
