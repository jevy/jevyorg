Okay.  So facebook is much more cultish than before.  The problem?  I love it.
Initially it sucked because there wasn't anything to do other than like post your profile.  So after you found all your "long lost friends" and sending one (or maybe two) "we haven't spoken in four years.  Sup?" type of messages it was over.

Now however people are posting videos and pictures like no tomorrow!  So much fun!  It's almost like blogging for idiots.  So for all those people who I know who don't have a blog, they're on facebook.  It's so much easier to keep up with people.

I'm outs for now guys, I need to go add more "friends" to validate myself as a human being.  I HAVE INTERNET FRIENDS.  W00t!
