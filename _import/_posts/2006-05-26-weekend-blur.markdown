The weekend's barely started and it's already packed full of stuff.  Fun stuff mind you, but still, I just want to sit around and not have anything planned at all.  Sometimes I almost dread getting up for Saturdays or Sundays more than I do for a day at work.  Maybe I should cut back.  Just thinking about it makes me want to take a nap.
