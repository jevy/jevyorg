So every two weeks or so, I try to get some new stuff on my iPod to listen to on those long days in the lab or on the bus.  I just found "The Official Lost Podcast".  Are you kidding me?  Humm.. to be honest, I'm actually tempted to subscribe to it just so I can maybe get some more clues about stuff.  WAIT NO!  I'm not that obsessed.  This is stupid...
