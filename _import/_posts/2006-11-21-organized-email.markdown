Personally, I think it's a very efficient way to organize your life with other people.  It turns out not to be as an enjoyable experience when you try to get things done but the other person takes _days_ to reply when only ten seconds is needed for them to think about an answer and give it to you.

Anyways, I wanted to post about how I keep my email organized.

<strong>Background</strong>: For years I kept all my email on my server in my basement (also the same place jevy.org is hosted).  I used Mozilla Thunderbird to read from my main desktop and mutt to read mail when I was away from home.  One day when everything turned to crap, I got a gmail account to use as a back up when my server decided to die on me.  For the past two years, I've ditched my server setup to exclusively use Gmail.

<strong>What I used to do</strong>:  I originally I never used the "archive" feature on Gmail at all.  I used to star all the conversation the conversations that I needed to follow up on when I didn't have the time or wasn't ready to right now.  The problem with that is that is when new messages come in, those starred ones get pushed to the next page and rarely noticed.  From time to time I'd click the "starred" label to realize "oh crap!  I was supposed to take care of that two weeks ago!".

<strong>Now</strong>:  Good 'ol Jimmy.  I saw him checking his email when he only had three or four emails in his inbox.  Then it hit me how Gmail had designed their system!  So silly of me.  So now, whenever I don't need emails anymore, I simply "archive" them.  You can still access them through all-mail or by searching them, but you don't have a cluttered inbox.  Right now for example, I have eight messages.  The last one that I received in Sept 10 that still has to be dealt with.  Some have stars if I _really_ want them to stand out but just having them in my face helps me get them done.

All in all, if you aren't using gmail, well... go get it.. if you are.. try this archiving thing.  If you're really ambicious, try turning on the keyboard shortcuts, it _really_ speeds things up.  Like "y" to archive this message.
